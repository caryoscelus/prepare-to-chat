If we moved in together, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off of you.", "And you thought my acting classes were a waste of money.", "[going through a box to find Sheldon's USB] Okay, I've got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.", "Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?", "Oh, look! She calls you Moon Pie! That is so cute!", "Who's Radiohead?", "Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.", "Okay, new topic, please.", "Typical.", "[referring to his earlier impersonation of Admiral Ackbar] Okay, now I see the squid head.", "Leonard, I don't know what to tell you; it was just a hug.", "Yeah.", "Okay, have a safe trip.", "Bye. [closes her door and sighs] It means I wish you weren't going.", "Are you fun in any of them?", "[aside to Leonard] Am I a matchmaker or what?", "Come on, Sheldon, let's go home - we're done fighting.", "There's gonna be no more shouting and no skeet shooting.", "Oh, my God, would you let this go?!", "Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? [takes robot from Sheldon and turns it off] Sheldon, please, try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we're gonna fight. But - no matter what happens between us, we'll always love you. Right, Leonard?", "You know, how 'bout we buy you this robot and we all go home?", "Okay, we'll buy you that one.", "Buy him the robot, Leonard. [Leonard walks off to buy the robot]", "[mom-like tone and face] Yes, you can. [Sheldon runs off]", "No, the light's been on since I bought the car.", "It's not gonna explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.", "I dislocated my shoulder.", "You already know that.", "No.", "No.", "Getting one.", "No.", "Change migraine to 'yes'.", "Oh, Next question!", "Oh, my God! What the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?!", "Ass!", "Different how?", "Are you high?", "Because I'm stupid.", "Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?", "2,600 years?", "I have to go to the bathroom.", "Not for 2,600 years...", "That'll be the Del Taco.", "[aside to Leonard] The toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?", "[at the restaurant] What are you doing here?", "So that's it? You just walked in and they hired you just like that?", "Well, here we are.", "Yep.", "Okay, sweetie I don't know if we're gonna have cookies or he's just gonna say hi so let me do the talking and... [Stan Lee comes out]", "Are you Stan Lee?", "Hi, I'm Penny and this is my friend Sheldon...", "Anyway, Sheldon is a huge fan and he was supposed to be at your signing but he kind of, ended up in jail, so we got your address and...", "No Sheldon, I said, I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.", "I'm sorry. He doesn't really understand sarcasm.", "Who's Adam West?", "So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?", "The Wesley Crushers?", "I don't get it.", "Still don't get it.", "Okay, I'm sorry honey, but the \"Wesley Crushers\" sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.", "Okay, well, what do you communicate about?", "[spits out her beverage and is offered a napkin by Howard's robot] Thank you.", "Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?", "No, no. My point is tonight is Sheldon's first official date. Discuss.", "So, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?", "Uh, I wouldn't say many. A few. [Sheldon chuckles] What's [imitating chuckle]?", "Wha-Where did you get 171 men?", "Whoa, wait, wait, wait, I did not start dating at 15.", "14.", "No!", "Okay, Sheldon, I think you made your point.", "Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. [To a passing waiter] I'm gonna need a drink over here.", "No! No! [suddenly unsure] No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?", "Have you ever run before?", "No, it won't.", "Alrighty! What's new?", "Uh, I got it, but what I was going for was\u2014you know\u2014how's your life?", "Well, I would ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays, and even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words \"pie\" or \"cheesecake\", and Leonard is lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.", "You want the fruit platter?", "Yeah.", "You know, sometimes stuff just happens and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.", "You know Amy, when we say girl talk that just doesn't have to be about our lady parts.", "So, what do you girls wanna do tonight? Should we go to the club or to the movies?", "[after Zack leaves] You know, for a bunch of guys who claim to have spent a lot of their life being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.", "[opening door back up] You laughed. [Raj immediately shuts up]", "Hey, you guys ready to order?", "[writing] Okay, so the usual with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.", "[about going with the others to a science conference including a spa treatment] Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages!", "You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept \"Don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat\". [leaves]", "Hey, Leonard, is your Wi-Fi down? I can't get on.", "[typing on her phone] Thanks. What are you guys doing?", "Oh, how'd he do?", "That bad, huh?", "[reading from Leonard's phone] \"Listening to Dr. Cooper's made me want to start cutting myself again.\"", "[to Howard] Y'know, I think I know how you did the card trick.", "C'mere. [whispers in Howard's ear]", "Not too bad for someone who doesn't know what \"axiomatic\" means.", "Did you know that last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading on the beach? Can you believe that?", "I'm the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. He was so phobic about stepping on medical waste I'd carry him to the water.", "So what's the thanks that I get for turning Leonard into a quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend!", "Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?", "Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?", "Yeah, you're a scientist, where is the curiosity?", "What the hell did she say?", "[short pause] That bitch!", "You wanna talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.", "It makes him desperate to please women. That's where the foreplay goes on and on.", "It's like he's trying to win a prize. Oh, word of advice, do not doze off, you'll never hear the end of it.", "We should have never slept together. It's what ruins friendships.", "Oh, it's no problem. It's actually kind of funny: You reading, me reading, we're like an old married couple.", "I don't have iced tea and snicker-doodles.", "I want a divorce.", "[points to dice] Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.", "What do you mean \"vastly wealthy\"?", "Well, so how much is that?", "Raj is naive. He hasn't dated a whole lot of women. [Howard gets distracted by two women at the reception desk behind them] and I'm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him, by letting him buy you lots of expensive things and I...[realizes that Howard hasn't been translating] Howard! Focus. Tell her what I'm saying.", "Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.", "Yeah, we feel awful.", "Oh, come on, Amy.", "[getting sick] I don't really want to.", "[Talking about screenplay writer in bar] No, I'm talking to him because he's cute.", "Yes he is, with his dorky t-shirt and his little hipster glasses.", "Yeah, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.", "[placing it on Amy's head] You look beautiful!", "Oh, that's a good question. How about \"awkward\"?", "Okay.", "[laughs] Okay let's see, I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl I dreamed of moving to LA and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I've done a hemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above the bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true! Your turn!", "[laughs] Bat Signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?", "[laughs] What does that mean?", "[laughs] You are so funny!", "That was a really nice dinner. I'm glad you asked me out again.", "You see me all the time. Are you sure you just don't miss the sex?", "I have. You are... not wrong. [pauses] I just think if we're gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.", "Okay, well maybe not THAT slow.", "Yup, just for fun, let's say I'm not.", "You mean like a Beta test?", "Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing Beta test?", "[sitting on Sheldon's spot, starts to move when she sees him] Hey, sorry Sheldon, I'll move.", "Okay, what just happened?", "All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.", "All right, honey, look. We've known each other for a long time now, right? I've taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you \"Soft Kitty\" when you're sick, you've even seen me naked once.", "It's a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing. Please let me cut your hair.", "Oh, that's great, let's open it up and put him in there!", "Why? They're just toys.", "C'mon, can't we open one up and take a look?", "Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. I gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.", "Hang on, I know. He's the wheelchair-dude who invented time.", "So, I hear you and the Lost Boys are having a Bachelor Party tonight.", "Why should I worry?", "Come on Leonard. It's you. What's gonna happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you'd do is avoid eye contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.", "All right. Howard and Bernadette. I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you\u2019re in love in doesn't matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.", "Problem?", "Oh, grow up.", "Well, he started it.", "Yeah, it\u2019s fun, isn't it?", "All right, who\u2019s ready for another beer?", "Girls.", "Okay, hold on\u2026", "That\u2019s enough.", "Raj!", "Oh, my God, Sheldon?!", "What are you doing in my bedroom?", "How did you even get in, you weirdo?", "What do you want, Sheldon?", "Talk about what?", "Sheldon.", "Okay, go home, crazy man.", "Okay, what did Amy tell you?", "Okay, you listen to me. I think it\u2019s really sweet you\u2019re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?", "Of course not!", "Worst bedtime story ever!", "Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?", "Get out.", "What?", "[Sighs] That is the last thing I want to do.", "Oh, it\u2019s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I\u2019m Penny.", "In a way. We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.", "Well, a lot of people can\u2019t. Uh, hey.", "My limbic system wants to take your pants off.", "You\u2019re unbelievable.", "Alright, standard State Fair pie eating contest rules are no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.", "[reading a text] Uh it's from Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.", "I do it's just that he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kinda creepy.", "Elves? Leonard, it's too early for Lord of the Rings.", "[reading the paper's headline] \"The Effects of Slavery in the Old South, 1602-1865\". What the hell is this?", "Hey. Shouldn't you be out with your gang spray painting equations on the side of buildings?", "I just can't believe you don't trust me.", "Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend who, by the way, knew exactly who you were.", "Your picture's on my refrigerator!", "What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?", "Leonard. Why do you always do this? Listen to me. You are the one I'm with. You know I love you. So would you please relax because you are driving me crazy!", "[stunned] Yeah.", "That's \u2026 exactly what we're going to do because you're about to make me cry and we both know that if I start crying, you're going to start crying.", "Fine! [Runs down stairs]", "All right. Maybe we should change the subject. Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?", "You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My..my sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. [Laughs] It\u2019s a bad idea.", "Damn.", "Anyway, to this day, I still can\u2019t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.", "Really? That\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna spend your Saturday night?", "Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?", "Oh, damn it, you are.", "I don\u2019t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?", "Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.", "[pause] No.", "Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?", "Why are you smiling?", "Well, I do.", "Good.", "What\u2019s that?", "Can I tell you a secret?", "Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we\u2019re all gonna stop.", "Hey Stuart.", "... No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.", "Sheldon, can I ask you a question?", "You ever gonna sleep with Amy?", "Maybe you don't, I do. What's the deal?", "All right, come on. Be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?", "Then what's the problem?", "Okay, hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might...actually get physical?", "[silently, grabbing Leonard's shoulder] Oh, my God! Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.", "Yep. I know. I\u2019m a total bitch.", "Well, I am.", "I don\u2019t know. Maybe because things are going so well between us lately and I\u2019ve been really happy.", "Obviously I have some commitment issues.", "As long as things keep going great between us, you\u2019ll keep asking me to marry you and eventually I\u2019m going to end saying yes then we\u2019re going to be married forever and the whole thing just freaks me out.", "What? What do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?", "Really?", "You got it.", "Okay. You know what, this might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.", "Leonard Hofstader.", "Would you be my valentine?", "You love her very much. Don't you?", "You think you have great capacity for devotion. You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you? I understand about it.", "When I was a very young girl. When I was sixteen years old I made the discovery. Love. All at once much, much too completely. Like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something had always been half a shadow. That's how it struck the world for me. Then I was unlucky to lose it.", "Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I've slept with guys for less. [Everyone stares at her.] It's a joke! Based on real events.", "Yeah, you just have to remember that that ride is shorter then you think. And they take a picture at the end so make sure you have all your clothes back on. [Everyone stares at her] It's a joke!! ...Based on real events.", "The letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?", "Yeah, obviously.", "We were all thinking it, really. Kind of the elephant in the room.", "Yeah. And he said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.", "It was a letter explaining that your Dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually his other life caught up to him and the only way to keep you and your Mom safe was to leave.", "So who do you have to smooze to get this deal?", "That's great. That takes a lot of integrity.", "Oh good, you heard me.", "So I was thinking about how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.", "You see that\u2019s the kind of passion I didn't think I had. But then I realize I\u2019m passionate about you.", "Well I\u2019m serious. Look I always had these plans to be in the movies, to live this glamorous life and anything else in my life just wasn't worth getting excited about.", "Oh, obviously it\u2019s going to happen. A psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway what I meant was I shouldn't wait. You know, I got you. I got Sheldon. These wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.", "It is, isn't it?", "Leonard, I had an epiphany; not a stroke.", "Oh, it\u2019s not so bad. You lost money, you feel shame and you got groped by a stranger. That\u2019s Vegas. You nailed it.", "Wow Hawking, good for you!", "For how long.", "Whoa. When would you leave?", "Wow. OK. Well, I\u2019ll just come visit you.", "On a ship? Aren\u2019t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?", "Oh sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Well, OK. Four months.", "Oh, sweetie. If you\u2019re going to do anything to screw things up, it\u2019s going to be while you\u2019re here, not while you\u2019re away.", "Are you OK?", "I\u2019m so sorry.", "Oh. Raj.", "I known how you feel. I miss Leonard too", "You will.", "That\u2019s just the booze talking.", "You're talking to me.", "Ahh!", "Me too!", "Why don\u2019t you admit you only want to play this game because you always play with Leonard and you miss him?", "Mmm.", "OK, I get it. I get it. You\u2019re an emotionless robot.", "Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Why don\u2019t you just admit you don\u2019t want to be on a team with me?", "Hm-mm. Yea. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough. You just think I\u2019m going to be a liability. Even though I totally just used liability correctly in a sentence.", "Oh no, no. Let\u2019s mix things up. I choose Sheldon and we\u2019re going to kick your ass.", "Thank you. Do you want me to be on my team?", "Oh, good. Check it out. \u201cThe Disappointed Child\u201d by Beverly Hofstadter.", "Yes. It\u2019s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.", "Oh cool. Are there pictures?", "Oh come on. How bad could it be?", "Not even the chapter on the breast feeding crisis?", "Oh my God. You still go left.", "I don\u2019t know why, but I always pictured her as Indian.", "I\u2019m going to talk to her.", "I\u2019m not going to say anything. I\u2019m going just want to talk her out. She hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who\u2019s racist now?", "Yeah, well, you\u2019re short.", "Hi. Can I start off with something to drink?", "Okay. Um, you\u2019re Lucy, right? I\u2019m a friend of Rajesh Koothrappali. You see, Amy recognized you.", "Oh, you know. He\u2019s good.", "Yeah. This is none of my business, but why did you break up with him in an email?", "Yea, I get that. I\u2019ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? Cause it certainly didn\u2019t make it easier for him.", "I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s rude of me. I will get you that water. See, see, see, see. Just now, you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you can do that with me and not with Raj?", "You know what the worst part is? You\u2019re sitting here perfectly happy and he\u2019s at home a blubbering mess.", "Well, I also said I was getting your water, but look at me. Still standing here. You know, maybe I\u2019m a bad waitress, but you\u2019re a bad person. Now, you want to hear the special?", "Sheldon you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.", "Yeah. Back when I we dating Zack. Actually it was more fun than I thought. We gambled, went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels. We had a really good turkey dinner which was surprising since we were at a strip club.", "Yeah.", "We had one those silly fake weddings.", "No, they\u2019re not. [Laughing it off]", "[Looking worried] No, they\u2019re not.", "[quietly] It didn\u2019t seem real.", "Zack, we don't have any children!", "He's counting Hobbits and superheroes, right?", "We do?", "Hey, Sheldon.", "Doing laundry?", "Oh my inference is justified. Sheldon you are so funny, Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who is wearing them.", "[Listening to the story.] OK, that\u2019s enough.", "[pointing to her bra] So what do you think?", "Please Sheldon, I need you.", "To take me.", "Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.", "I think I know how to change your mind.", "[entering] Hey.", "Look I know you we\u2019re trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn't mean to call it idiotic.", "Oh. Sorry. I meant to. Anyway. Um. I was just upset with myself. I wasn't mad at you. I feel like everything is falling apart.", "No it\u2019s not okay. Look at me. Okay. I took a temp job as a waitress like forever ago and I\u2019m still doing it. And I can\u2019t quit because guess what I can\u2019t do anything else. And I finally get my big break. And it goes away. I\u2019m such a mess.", "Really? \u2018Cause this morning at Starbucks a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn't the only one in there.", "No it\u2019s not. I've been out here for like ten years and have nothing to show for it.", "You\u2019re right. I do have you. Hmm. Let\u2019s get married.", "Ohh. [kneeling] Leonard Hofstadter. Will you marry me?", "Did you seriously just say, \u201cUmm?\u201d", "Okay. So-so, you don\u2019t want to marry me?", "No, forget it. I take it back, the offer\u2019s off the table.", "I\u2019m going to go.", "No, no. I just need to be alone.", "Why doesn't Leonard get it?", "Yeah, well, maybe we do.", "Okay, wait? What are we doing?", "You guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?", "Translation?", "It's a sequel of that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.", "What is this? My first day?", "Huh?", "Wait, what's wrong with geology?", "So we're about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.", "But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere, except my cleavage. So, I ask the director why and he says it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.", "[running to a psychic's booth] I think I see our next stop!", "There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.", "You think you're 5-foot-6. That's funny.", "You taught him well, Padawan.", "Look who's back.", "What happens if you don't?", "Hey, how was dinner?", "Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.", "I think the message is, \"Check out the rack on that scientist!\""], "Melanie": ["Who?", "We don't really have any.", "Three hours.", "What does mildew smell like?", "[Reading] I'm halfway through this thing and the stupid whale hasn't even shown up yet.", "Are you joking?

Because.", "I don't know.", "Not offhand.", "Since when?", "I'm gobsmacked."], "Alec": ["I'm gonna be out of here in five minutes and go back to my cell and you'll get rid of me for the night.

Maybe you've seen him around.", "Hairy. Lots of growling, some barking--", "Like that.", "It was just a summer fling.", "Looking for you. The fact is, I should be with my own kind. Was wondering if you hooked up with any of the others.", "It's just 'cause she's hot, you know.", "Everything. Everything she gets away with.

I'm gonna smack your bitch head.\" It's so unfeminine.", "Please tell me you're gonna get naked.", "I'm thinking.", "I can do both.", "Well, you just lost your tip.", "Funny, women and water. Seems to be the theme of my evening.", "Scored a sweet deal on some ham-hocks, my buyer fell through on me, you want em?", "Aw, that's alright, take it as an 'I'm sorry for trying to kill you' that one time", "Look, Josh, you\u2019re a great artist, apparently.

Barkeep!", "I don't want your pity. I want your absence.", "I'm always alright.", "I mean, why consummate two years of unbridled passion when we can have pasta?", "Is that the one where Captain Kirk dies?", "Have they ever even once said \"I love you\"?

We're getting on that plane.", "Dean, that plane is leaving with over a hundred passengers on board, and if we're right, that plane is gonna crash.", "Well, okay. We need to get on the plane, we need to find that demon and exorcise it. Look, I'll get the tickets and you just go get whatever you can from the trunk, whatever will get past security, and meet me back here in five minutes. [Dean looks shocked] You okay?", "What? What's wrong?", "Flying?", "You're joking, right?!", "Alright, uhh\u2026 I'll go.", "I'll do this one on my own.", "Look, Dean, we can do it together, I can do this one by myself. I'm not seeing a third option here.", "Are you humming Metallica?", "Look man, I get you're nervous alright, but you gotta stay focused.", "What if she's already possessed?", "No, I think we can go more subtle. If she's possessed she'll flinch at the name of God.", "Hey!", "Say it in Latin.", "Hey!", "Uhh... In Latin, it's Christo.", "Hey, night vision? [Sam looks at Dean through the digital camera's night vision]", "I don't blame you.", "I could have warned her.", "No you don't.", "You don't know all about it. I haven't told you everything.", "Well, it wouldn't be a secret if I told you, would it?", "Dean, that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it. And you know what? Who knows how many people are going to die after that? Now, we're doing this. You've got to let me do this.", "Yeah?", "Charlie? [Charlie turns around] Your boyfriend's death. You really should try to forgive yourself. No matter what you did, you probably couldn't have stopped him. Sometimes bad things just happen. [Charlie acknowledges and leaves]", "Yeah?", "Look, you're my brother. And I'd die for you. But there are some things I need to keep to myself.", "...I was like you.", "What are you talkin\u2019 about?", "Yeah, it's me. He went to Becca's house... Looking like you.", "About what?", "Nah, it's ok. You know, the truth is even at Stanford, deep down I never really fit in.", "Yeah, thanks.", "[chuckles] Yeah, I know you are.", "Bite me.", "What about the shotgun?", "And he believed you?", "This wasn't really my experience.", "I'll take the house.", "Yeah, but hustling pool, credit card scams... It's not the most honest thing in the world, Dean.", "Yeah, well, how we were raised was jacked.", "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.", "Human Mad Cow Disease.", "You watch Oprah?", "I respected him. But no matter what I did, it was never good enough.", "Was? Is... and always has been.", "Because I didn't want to bow hunt...or hunt spirits because I wanted to go to school and live my life, which in our whacked out family made me the freak.", "Dean, you know what most dads are when their kids score a full ride? Proud. Most dads don\u2019t toss their kids out of the house.", "You know, truth is, when we finally do find Dad\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s even gonna wanna see me.", "What are you talkin\u2019 about?", "What?", "Why didn\u2019t you tell me any of that?", "Joe White Tree? [The man nods.] We\u2019d like to ask you a few questions, if that\u2019s all right.", "Have you heard of Oasis Plains? It\u2019s a housing development near the Atoka Valley.", "How'd you know all that?", "For what?", "[possessed] Is that an order?", "No.", "Dean, if this demon killed Mom and Jess, and Dad\u2019s closing in, we\u2019ve gotta be there. We\u2019ve gotta help.", "I don\u2019t care.", "[firmly] I don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t always have to do what he says.", "Alright, I understand, believe me, I understand. But I\u2019m talking one week here, man, to get answers. To get revenge.", "Do you? [Dean seems shocked at Sam\u2019s tone] How old were you when Mom died? Four? Jess died six months ago. How the hell would you know how I feel?", "I don\u2019t understand the blind faith you have in the man. I mean, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even question him.", "That's what you really think?", "Well, then this selfish bastard is going to California.", "I am serious.", "That\u2019s what I want you to do.", "The scarecrow crawled off its cross?", "I stole a car.", "No, I think you're stuck with me.", "I didn't. I still want to find Dad...And you're still a pain in the ass. But Jess and Mom...they're both gone. Dad is God knows where. You and me. We're all that's left. So, uh, if we're gonna see this through...we're gonna do it together.", "You should be kissing my ass - you were dead meat back there.", "Right.", "(sighs) I talked to your doctor.", "Dean.", "What are you talking about? I'm not leaving you here.", "I don't think that's funny.", "Don't talk like that, alright. We still have options.", "Watch me.", "I'm not gonna let you die period! We're going!", "Oh, and you might also want to mention that other thing.", "The serious unfinished business. Dean, what is going on between you two?", "Oh, OK. Yeah.", "No, look, man, everybody\u2019s gotta open up to someone, sometime.", "You loved her.", "You were in love with her, but you dumped her. Oh, wow. She dumped you.", "You TOLD her?! The big family secret? Rule number one - we do what we do and shut our mouths about it? For a year and a half I do nothing but lie to Jessica and you go out with this chick in Ohio a couple of times and you tell her everything? [Dean is silent] DEAN!", "And you think this vanishing truck ran him off the road?", "Dean, where are you?", "Occasionally I miss boring!", "I miss conversations that didn't start with \"this killer truck\"", "Huh. Honestly, that thought hadn't occurred to me!", "You mean you dated someone? For more than one night?", "Well, I know one thing I have in common with these people.", "Both our families are cursed.", "[chuckles] Our dark spots are pretty dark.", "We\u2019re not gonna kill Max.", "Well, I'll tell you one thing. We're lucky we had Dad.", "Well, he could\u2019ve gone a whole \u2018nother way after Mom. A little more tequila, a little less demon-hunting, and we would\u2019ve had Max\u2019s childhood. All things considered, we turned out okay\u2014thanks to him.", "Aren\u2019t you worried, man, aren\u2019t you worried that I could turn into Max or something?", "No. Why?", "Dad? Because Dad\u2019s not here, Dean.", "Where?", "Do what?", "You were worried about me!", "Sure you won't.", "So you got sidelined by a 13-year old girl?", "I'm just saying, getting a little rusty there aren't you, kiddo?", "Did you get anything...besides her number?", "You mind doing a little thinking with your upstairs brain, Dean?", "I'm just saying, there's something about this girl I can't quite put my finger on.", "I'm gonna watch Meg.", "I just wanna see what's what. Better safe than sorry.", "Dude.", "Yeah, once we\u2019re done huntin\u2019 the thing.", "Why, is there somethin\u2019 wrong with that?", "I mean, what are you gonna do when it\u2019s all over?", "But there\u2019s got to be somethin\u2019 that you want for yourself\u2014", "Dude, what\u2019s your problem?", "\u2018Cause Dad was in trouble. \u2018Cause you wanted to find the thing that killed Mom.", "Dean. We are a family. I'd do anything for you. But things will never be the way they were before.", "I don't want them to be. I'm not going to live this life forever. Dean, when this is all over, you're gonna have to let me go my own way.", "Hmm?", "All right. Just remember you started it.", "And after his time, too. The reversed cross has been used by Satanists for centuries, but this sigil of sulfur didn\u2019t show up in San Francisco until the sixties. [Dean looks at him strangely]", "Suicide?", "What are you thinkin'?", "I have a confession to make. I'm the one who called them up and told them I was a producer. [both laugh]", "Truce?", "[scoffs] Yeah, cause he's been so easy to find at this point.", "Yeah? what makes you so sure?", "No, it doesn't.", "I'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.", "Good call.", "Getting wise in your old age, Dean.", "Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.", "You know. I know I've given you a lot of crap for always following Dad's orders. But I know why you do it.", "It's too bad.", "It's not what I meant. I meant Michael. [pauses] He'll always know that there are things out there in the dark. He'll never be the same. You know... [pauses again] sometimes I wish that... [trails off]", "I wish I could have that kind of innocence.", "What's the point Dean? We'll just leave. We always leave.", "You know what, I don't get it. What do you care if I hook up?", "Yeah, I know she would. Yeah, you're right - part of this is about Jessica, but not the main part.", "Sarah, you saw that painting move.", "You're not delusional.", "But, I don't think this is a good idea.", "'Cause I like you.", "Killing others, killing herself. Some people are just born tortured. So when they die, their spirits are just as dark.", "I dunno, she was already cremated, there's nothin' left to burn.", "There must be somethin' else.", "Well that's fascinating Sarah, but important right now?", "Dean? Sarah says the doll might have the girl's real hair. Human remains, same as bones.", "What kind of house doesn't have salt? Low sodium freaks!", "And the razor...Dean!", "(answers the phone) Hey!", "No I think it's the little girl!", "The girl from the painting! I think it was her all along!", "Yeah, yeah, yeah! Lets re-cap later!", "That's probably what dad's thinking. [sullenly] 'Course, it'd be nice if he just told us what he thinks.", "What?", "[scoffs] No. Look, I'm happy he's okay, alright? And I'm happy that we're all working together again.", "...it's just the way he treats us, like we're children.", "What?", "No.", "Hey, Dad, whatever happened to that college fund?", "Yes, sir.", "Yes, sir.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not my fault, but it\u2019s my problem!", "Dean, uh, I want to thank you.", "For everything. You've always had my back, you know. Even when I couldn't count on anyone, I could always count on you. And, uh, I just wanted to let you know, just in case.", "What?", "If you had just let me go in there, I could have ended all this.", "You don\u2019t know that.", "Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re damn right I am.", "What the hell are you talkin\u2019 about, Dean? We\u2019ve been searching for this demon our whole lives. It\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ve ever cared about.", "What?", "That thing killed Jess. That thing killed Mom.", "Don\u2019t you say that! Don\u2019t you\u2014not after all this, don\u2019t you say that!", "We don\u2019t have it on us. We buried it.", "I wanna know why. Why\u2019d you do it?", "Yeah", "In the way of what?", "(looks at wounded Dean) No sir. Not before everything.", "Get back. Or I'll kill you I swear to God.", "(cocks the Colt) You wanna bet?", "(sceptically) Elroy McGillicuddy?", "I'll find some hoodoo priest to lay some mojo on him.", "Your son is dying and you're worried about the Colt?", "...it's in the trunk. They towed the car to a yard off of I-83.", "Hey Dad, you know, the demon, he said he had plans for me and the children like me. Do you have any idea what he meant by that?", "Oh man, (looking at the Impala) Dean is gonna be pissed.", "No, Dean would kill me if we did that. When he gets better he's going to want to fix this.", "Listen to me, Bobby: If there's only one working part, that's enough. We're not just going to give up on... (realizes he's no longer talking about the car)", "That's exactly my point!! Dean is dying, and you have a plan!!! You know, you care more about this demon than you do saving your own son!", "How? How is revenge gonna help him? You're not thinking about anybody but yourself- it's the same, selfish obsession!", "It was possessing you dad, I would've killed you too!", "Go to Hell.", "Hey. I think maybe you're around, and if you are, don't make fun of me for this, but, um, there's one way we can talk.", "Dean? Dean, are you here?", "Dean, are you here? Couldn't find anything in the book. I don't know how to help you. But I'll keep trying, alright? As long as you keep fighting. I mean, come on, you can't\u2014 you can't leave me here alone with Dad, we'll kill each other, you know that. Dean, you gotta hold on. You can't go, man, not now. We were just starting to be brothers again. Can you hear me?", "Where were you last night?", "Well, that's specific.", "Did you go after the Demon?", "You know, why don't I believe you right now?", "Dad, are you all right?", "Yeah. Yeah, sure.", "Before...before he... [He stops, unable to get the words out] Did he say anything to you? About anything?", "Stop what?", "All right. Dean, it\u2019s just\u2026we\u2019ve been at Bobby\u2019s for over a week now and you haven\u2019t brought up Dad once.", "So look, if you can help, we could use all the help we can get.", "Who's Ash?", "That's Ash?", "Can you track it or not?", "Gimme a break.", "At least I'm not afraid of flying.", "And apparently, clowns kill!", "Not really.", "Hey, man.", "Very funny.", "Why are you sayin' this to me?", "Oh, yeah. I\u2019ve got to, uh\u2026I\u2019ve got to go\u2026over there\u2026right now. [He leaves.]", "We were working a job, Ash. [Ash looks blankly at Sam] Clowns?", "Ash Where'd you learn to do all this?", "MIT?", "You were right.", "About me and Dad. I\u2019m sorry that the last time I was with him, I tried to pick a fight. I\u2019m sorry that I spent most of my life angry at him. I mean, for all I know, he died thinkin\u2019 that I hate him. So, you\u2019re right. What I\u2019m doin\u2019 right now - it is too little. It\u2019s too late. [pause] I miss him, man. And I feel guilty as hell. [He is on the verge of tears.] And I\u2019m not all right. Not at all. [pause] But neither are you. That much I know. I\u2019ll let you get back to work.

Reverse pentacle on the forehead.", "You open it.", "Dean, get me a bucket.", "No, I'm going to puke.", "So... we're looking for some people.", "Yeah, I'm fine.", "He's the only one who gets to call me that.", "(sighs) Look, I\u2019m not gonna bring you guys down, I'm just gonna go back to the motel.", "Yeah.", "I thought you said he [Gordon] was a good hunter?", "Yeah, Eli, that's enough!", "Right, because Gordon\u2019s such an old friend. You don\u2019t think I can see what this is?", "He\u2019s a substitute for Dad, isn\u2019t he? A poor one.", "He\u2019s not even close, Dean. Not on his best day.", "You slap on his big fake smile but I can see through it. 'Cause I know how you feel, Dean. Dad\u2019s dead, and he left a hole, and it hurt so bad you can\u2019t take it. But you can\u2019t just fill that hole with whoever you want to. It\u2019s an insult to his memory!", "You hit me all you want. It won\u2019t change anything.", "Ready to go, Dean?", "Yeah?", "What?", "No.", "You look like you just went 12 rounds with a block of cement, Dean. I\u2019ll take a rain check.", "Okay.", "Dean, after what happened to Mom, Dad did the best he could.", "You didn\u2019t kill Lenore.", "Yeah, Dean, but you didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s what matters.", "I guess I might have to stick around and be a pain in the ass, then.", "Don\u2019t mention it.", "Why?", "She has a headstone.", "Dean, that\u2019s not the point.", "It\u2019s not about a body or a casket. It\u2019s about her memory, okay? And after dad, it just-it just feels like the right thing to do.", "Look, man, no one asked you to come.", "That\u2019s a good idea. You should. Just drop me off. I\u2019ll hitch a ride, And I\u2019ll meet you tomorrow.", "Okay. So what are you thinking?", "Un...", "Yeah.", "You want to take another swing? Go ahead if it'll make you feel better.", "[off-handedly] Hey. ...What?", "You stole the girl's diary?", "So what do we do?", "You get any names?", "Burn the bones? Are you high? Angela died last week!", "So, there's not going to be bones! There's going to be a ripe, rotting body in the coffin!", "Stop. Please, Dean, it's killing you. Please. We've already lost Dad, we've lost Mom, I've lost Jessica and now I'm gonna lose you too.", "Our lives are weird, man.", "Dude, you've been watching way too many Romero flicks.", "No, Dean, I'm telling you there's too much. I mean, there's at least a hundred different legends on the walking dead, but they all have different methods for killing them. Some say setting them on fire... uh, one said [flipping through John's journal] ...where is it? Right here. \"Feeding their hearts to wild dogs.\" That's my personal favorite.", "You think Angela's going after somebody?", "Look, smartass, she might kill someone. We gotta find her, Dean.", "Yeah.", "Did we have to use me as bait?", "I think she broke my hand.", "You -- For what?", "What are you talking about?", "Dean.", "We don't know that. Not for sure.", "So, I\u2019m a freak now?", "Ash. [knocks again] ...Hey, Ash!", "Hey, Ash... We need your help.", "Alright, try something else for me.

Andy's got the Impala!", "You what?!", "Yeah. Real Samaritan, this guy.", "Well, we're lawyers. See, a relative of yours has passed...", "That's what I'm...", "[Shocked.] Dean!", "Dean! Shut up!", "A lot of people would say the same thing about what you do.", "Yeah.", "But you still live in a van. I don\u2019t get it. I mean, you could have anything you ever wanted.", "So, you\u2019re really not a killer, huh?", "That\u2019s good. It means there\u2019s hope for both of us.", "Andy, it's true. Holly Beckett was your birth mother.", "Dr. Jennings was her doctor too... I mean, he oversaw the adoption. You have a solid connection to both of them.", "I think I've got a pretty good guess. Holly Beckett gave birth to twins.", "Dean, you should stay back.", "What?", "What are you, 7?", "Yeah. Girl got a name?", "That's funny... and for you, so bitchy.", "So, this job as glamorous as you thought it would be?", "Yes, Ma'am!", "We saw the second-largest ball of twine in the continental U.S. Awesome.", "I'm not Scully, you're Scully.", "Anthony Gyles' body was found right about here.

We've got to be more careful now.", "I'm sure they just...haven't posted it yet.", "Shut up.", "No, I'm not!", "Whatever they are, they're big, nasty...", "So?", "You didn't happen to ask her if she's seen any black dogs lately, did you?", "You mean Carly's MySpace address?", "We gotta find out if anyone else struck any bargains around here.", "So, what, we should just leave them to die?", "Yeah, so whatever kind of deal he made...", "He did it for you.", "Hey Dean.", "When you were trapping that demon, you weren't...I mean, it was all a trick, right? You never considered actually making that deal, right?", "I sure hope so.", "I never said you would!", "Fine. Look, we don\u2019t know what it is.

That's Schoolhouse Rock!", "Big time.", "What do you think? Multiple demons? Mass possession?", "Great.", "I don\u2019t know, man.

We\u2019re supposed to struggle with this, that\u2019s the whole point!", "A clear conscience, for one.", "What the hell has happened to you?", "You might kill an innocent man, and you don\u2019t even care! You don\u2019t act like yourself anymore, Dean. Hell, you know what? You\u2019re acting like one of those things out there.", "Dean, they\u2019re right. I\u2019m infected. Just give me the gun and I\u2019ll do it myself.", "Dean, I\u2019m not gonna become one of those things.", "Dean!", "Dean, no. No. Go with them. This is your only chance.", "Dean, don\u2019t do this. Just get the hell out of here.", "Give me my gun\u2026and leave.", "This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.", "Dean, I\u2019m sick. It\u2019s over for me.

I mean, you\u2019re just gonna lay down and die? Look, Dean, I know the stuff with Dad had\u2014", "What is it about?", "What?", "Dean, you're my brother, alright? So whatever weight you're carrying, let me help a little bit.", "Who?", "What are you talking about?", "What? Dean, what did he tell you?", "What? Dean, what did he tell you?", "He told you that a million times.", "Save me from what?", "You\u2019d what, Dean?", "Kill me? What the hell is that supposed to mean?", "I mean, he must\u2019ve had some kind of reason for saying it, right? Did he know the demon\u2019s plans for me? Am I supposed to go dark-side or something?! What else did he say, Dean", "How could you not have told me this?!", "Who cares? Take some responsibility for yourself, Dean! You had no right to keep this from me!", "[after a long pause] We\u2019ve just gotta figure out what\u2019s going on then, what the hell all this means.", "What? That I don\u2019t turn evil? That I don\u2019t turn into some kind of killer?", "Jeez, if you\u2019re not careful, you will have to waste me one day, Dean.", "Forget it.", "What, you got an address?", "You okay?", "These are .223 Caliber, subsonic rounds, the guy must've put a suppressor on the rifle.", "I ah...I just I...I just watch a lot of TJ Hooker.", "Yeah, I'm sorry. Look, right now there's someone after me.", "I don't know, that's what we've gotta find out. Where are you?", "Yeah, sure.", "My brother's in trouble.", "He gave me a codeword. Someone's got a gun on him.", "Yeah. Funkytown. (beat) Well, he thought of it. It's kind of a . . .long story. I ... come on.", "It\u2019s Sam.", "Anonymous tip.", "What? You'd kill me?", "All right, so where to next, man?", "Dean!", "Look, Dean, I've tried running before. I mean I ran all the way to California, and look what happened. You can't run from this. And you can't protect me.", "Thanks for that.", "So if you really want to watch my back, I guess you\u2019re going to have to stick around.", "Jerk.", "We've gotta save as many people as we can.", "Like what?", "What?! No, uh no, we're... Two singles. We're just brothers.", "Well, you are kind of butch. They probably think you're overcompensating.", "(reluctantly) Big time.", "(glaring at Dean) It\u2019s true.", "You're bossy.", "You're bossy... and short. (laughs)", "Yeah! So? ...stupid.", "(Leaning over the toilet) I can still taste the Tequila.", "(groaning) I hate you.", "So you think she taught Rose hoodoo?", "All right. (gets up from toilet bowl, sighing heavily) I think it's time that we talked to Rose then.", "Yeah, what do you wanna do, poke her with a stick? (Dean nods) Dude, you are not gonna poke her with a stick!", "Yeah. Yeah, it does. But it doesn't change what we talked about last night, Dean.", "You know what I mean.", "But you weren't. And you promised.", "They're just doing their job.", "A Juan doll?", "A mandroid?", "What, are you pissed at me or something?", "[laugh] Mandroid?", "Yeah, except he's not a hunter Dean. He's just a guy who stumbled onto something real. If he went up against this, he'd get torn apart. Better to stay in the dark and stay alive.", "Shapeshifter. Just like back at St. Louis. Same retinal reaction to video.", "You think I don't?", "What if he's the shifter?", "I didn't know this was gonna happen, Dean.", "We're not working for the mandroid.", "Fair enough.", "He\u2019s my brother.", "So, no disturbances lately?", "And this angel\u2026", "And the word was\u2026 to kill someone?", "Dean. You're enjoying that way too much. It's kinda making me uncomfortable.", "She's living in a locked ward, and she's totally at peace.", "Wait. There's no such thing as unicorns?", "And you got angels on the \u201cBull Crap\u201d list?", "Why?", "So what?", "Dean, you and I have seen things most people couldn\u2019t even dream about.", "I\u2019m laughing on the inside.", "Dude, I'm not enabling your sick habit. You're like one of those lab rats that pushes the pleasure button instead of the food button until it dies.", "Uh...", "I do.", "I do pray everyday. I have for a long time.", "Dean, I saw an angel! (Dean offers him flask) I don\u2019t want a drink.", "It appeared before me and I just... this feeling washed over me. You know? Like peace. Like grace.", "Dean, the angel hasn\u2019t been wrong yet! Someone\u2019s gonna do something awful, and I can stop it!", "You know what, Dean, I don\u2019t understand! Why can\u2019t you even consider the possibility?", "Yes! Maybe we\u2019re hunting an angel here, and we should stop! Maybe this is God\u2019s will!", "You never told me that.", "What? Here? In the church?", "Ha! A s\u00e9ance, great.

You're scared because your year is running out and you're still going to hell, and you're freaked.", "Because I know you!", "Yeah, because I've been following you around my entire life!

It's just that, uh, well you know, Mr. Gung-Ho Christmas, might have to blow away Santa.", "(getting off the phone with Bobby) Well, we're not dealing with the anti-Claus.", "Uh, that we're morons.", "No, Jesus' birthday was probably in the fall. It was actually the Winter Solstice Festival that was co-opted by the church and renamed Christmas. But I mean the Yule log, the tree, even Santa's red suit, that's all remnants of Pagan worship.", "Yeah. It's pretty much like putting a neon sign on your front door, saying \"Come kill us!\"", "Huh, when you sacrifice to Holnacar, guess what he gives you in return?", "Sure. (Sam pauses to look at shop owner) It was yummy.", "She didn't charge you?", "I don't get it. You haven't talked about Christmas in years.", "I know. That's why I can't.", "I mean, I can't just sit around, drinking eggnog, pretending everything's okay, when I know next Christmas, you'll be dead. I just can't.", "Dean, you okay?", "So I guess we're dealing with \"Mr. and Mrs. God.\" Nice to know.", "Pretty much.", "They're working black magic, too, Dean. They need to be stopped.", "They're murderers.", "What? What the hell was I thinking?", "Look, I know it's dangerous, that she is dangerous, but like it or not, she's useful.", "Kill her with what? The gun she fixed for us?", "Dean, if she wants us dead, all she has to do is stop saving our lives.", "It's not so simple. We're not- we're not just hunting anymore. We're at war.", "Why are you always asking me that?", "Yeah, and what has that gotten me?", "Wait, so you're mad because I'm starting to agree with you?", "Look, Dean, you're leaving, right? And I got to stay here in this crap hole of a world... alone. So, the way I see it, if I'm gonna make it, if I'm gonna fight this war after you're gone, then I gotta change.", "Into you. I gotta be more like you.", "Having a drink.", "I drink whiskey all the time.", "But really, the thing is, no one can save you.", "No, that's not what I mean. I mean no one can save you because you don't want to be saved.", "What was Bobby doing in Pittsburgh?", "When don't we?", "You wanna go dream walking inside Bobby's head?", "We have no idea what's crawling around in there.", "Bad!", "One problem though, we're fresh out of African Dream Root, so unless you know anyone who can score some...", "What?", "Bela? Crap. You're actually suggesting we ask her for a favor?", "What? No one. Nothing.", "No!", "No. No!", "Why?", "Dean, you didn't.", "That's great! Now he can come after either one of you.", "Yeah?", "Alright, yeah. We'll find a way to save you.", "Dude, Asia?", "Yeah, and if I ever hear it again, I'm gonna kill myself.", "Okay sure. Let's get right on that. Where is she again?", "Man, I had a weird dream.", "Yesterday was Tuesday, right? But today is Tuesday, too!", "He'll take the special, side of bacon, coffee black. Nothing for me thanks.", "You peed yourself.", "You'll thank me when it's Wednesday.", "My point is I\u2019ve lived through every possible Tuesday. I\u2019ve watched you die every possible way. I have ripped apart the Mystery Spot, burnt it down, tried everything I know to save your life and I can\u2019t. No matter what I do, you die. And then I wake up. And then it\u2019s Tuesday again.", "Eat your breakfast.", "So this is fun for you? Killing Dean over and over again?", "(looking at alarm playing Back in Time) It's Wednesday!", "What, are you kidding? This isn't the most beautiful song you've ever heard?", "You were possessed.", "That's what it feels like. Now you know.", "It got stolen.", "Ruby-", "Ok, so what's the plan.", "Yeah.", "Eew.", "Well that explains why all the death echoes are here.", "They're here because their bodies are here\u2026Somewhere in the house.", "Loneliness.", "Yeah, I mean it-it's bizarre how y'all are able to uh...to honor Corbett's memory while grossly exploiting the manner of his death. Well done.", "Yeah Alright guys.", "Right, uh, our experience, you know what you get when you show the world the truth?", "Right", "Yeah.", "Ugh.", "(about a demon) And it's following you because...?", "Dean, it's not Dad.", "A Crocotta.", "And me.", "What?", "Do you want a poem?", "I talked to Mr. Beetle's doctor. Turns out his incisions were sewn up with silk.", "Yeah, nowadays it is, but silk used to be the suture of choice back in the early 19th-century. It was really problematic. Patients would get massive infections, the death rate was insane.", "Right. So, doctors, they had to do whatever they could to keep the infections from spreading. One way was maggots.", "It actually kind of worked because maggots, they eat the bad tissue and they leave good tissue. And get this: When they found our guy, his body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.", "Even if you had the Colt, Dean, who're you gonna shoot? We have no idea who holds the ticket!", "I'm stayin' here.", "So if we do save you...let's never do that.", "You don't mean that. We're--we're family.", "No Bobby. Of course not.", "I'm not gonna let you go to hell, Dean!", "Then what am I supposed to do?", "(walking into view) Hey is-? (cuts off when he see Dean and Bobby)", "Dean?", "(struggling against Bobby) Who are you?!", "(Still fighting Bobby's hold on him) Do what?", "What? No. No. He's my brother.", "The girl? I don't pay, Dean.", "I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the Devil's Gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in Hell for months. For months, and I couldn't stop it. So I'm sorry it wasn't me, alright? Dean, I'm sorry.", "That's an iPod jack.", "Yeah, she's gonna eat you alive.", "Yeah, I just gotta figure out the right way to say it. Look, I just need time, okay? That's all.", "He's going to be pissed anyway. I mean, he's so hardheaded about this psychic stuff he'll just try and stop me.", "Ruby, you...", "I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Hell, I don't even know if I trust you.", "But what I do know is that I'm saving people. And stopping demons. And that feels good. I want to keep going.", "What's happening here, Ruby?", "We were thinking some high level demon pulled Dean out!", "What can?", "Yeah. You just did, Dean.", "Dean, we have a theory.", "Apparently, you're a regular guy that's important to the man upstairs.", "Okay, well, too bad, Dean. Because I think he wants you to strap on your party hat.", "[On phone] Yes, Dean, I'll get the chips. Dude. When have I ever forgotten the pie? Exactly.", "Is what true?", "We're not sure but we think so!", "What?", "What do you know about them?", "I'm not scared of angels!", "Yeah?", "Spirit activity.", "Somethings up, huh?", "Okay, where are we going?", "You built a panic room!?", "What are you talking about?", "Okay, so, what do we do now?", "Should. Great.", "The fireplace in the library.", "Meg.", "Where's Lilith?", "I'd watch myself if I were you.", "Shut your mouth.", "Dean, hold on, okay? Just let me...", "Ruby! Stop it!", "Dean, what are you doing? What, are you, are you leaving?", "Hold on. Dean, come on, man. (Dean punches Sam in the face) You satisfied? (Dean hits him again) I guess not.", "I'm just exorcising demons.", "I can send them back to hell. It only works with demons, and that's it.", "I told you!", "Look, I should have said something. I'm sorry, Dean. I am. But try to see the other side here.", "I'm pulling demons out of innocent people.", "The knife kills the victim! What I do, most of them survive! Look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year.", "I'm not gonna let it go too far.", "You were gone. I was here. I had to keep on fighting without you. And what I'm doing... It works.", "What?", "I should have told you. I'm sorry.", "Only Jack Montgomery in town.", "Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird.", "Yeah.", "I don't know, Dean. Travis seemed pretty sure. (Jack Montgomery starts to eat raw meat) I'd say that qualifies as weird.", "No.", "He means human flesh.", "You want to know why I've been lying to you, Dean? Because of crap like this.", "The way you talk to me, the way you look at me like I'm a freak!", "You know, or even worse, like I'm an idiot! Like I don't know the difference between right and wrong! What?", "You have no idea what I'm going through. None.", "I've got demon blood in me, Dean. This disease pumping through my veins and I can't ever rip it out or scrub it clean. I'm a whole new level of freak! And I'm just trying to take this - this curse... and make something good out of it. Because I have to.", "(to Jack Montgomery) Listen to me, you've got this dark pit inside you. I know. Believe me, I know. But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it. You don't have to be a monster...It doesn't matter what you are. It only matters what you do. It's your choice.", "Don't worry about it, Dean.", "Look, if it's all the same... I'd really rather not talk about it.", "There's nothing more to say. I can't keep explaining myself to you. I can't make you understand.", "I can't. Because this thing, this blood, it's not in you the way it's in me. It's just something I gotta deal with.", "Anyway, it doesn't matter. These powers... it's playing with fire. I'm done with them. I'm done with everything.", "Don't thank me. I'm not doing it for you. Or for the angels or for anybody. This is my choice.", "Saw it.", "You were in hell.", "Can you describe her assailant?", "Re...hy...Please.

After that guy choked down all those razor blades?", "Yeah. For us, every day is Halloween.", "What about you? Find anything on the victim?", "Once he's raised, Samhain can do some raising of his own.", "Dark, evil crap and lots of it.

It\u2019s an honor, really, I- I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.", "No, but...", "Okay, we already know who she is, so if we work together-", "There are a thousand people here.", "And you\u2019re willing to kill them all?", "We'll stop this witch before she summons anyone.

This is what I've been praying to?", "It just doesn't make any sense, Dean. I mean, why would Uriel tell me you remembered hell if you didn't?", "Okay. Fine. Then look me in the eye and tell me you don't remember a thing from your time down under.", "Look, Dean, I just want to help.", "Eye witness reports of a ghost that's been haunting the showers of a woman's health facility (Dean chokes on beer then downs the rest).

Yeah, he's, he's got...", "Lollipop disease.", "Yeah. So is there-is there someone, maybe a grown up, you can stay with while we treat him?", "What are you gonna wish for?", "No. Wouldn't be real. I wouldn't trust it.", "Yeah.", "Not what I'd wish for.", "It's too late to go back to our old lives, Dean. I'm not that guy anymore.", "Lilith's head on a plate. Bloody.", "Sir, I don't want to slap you with a 44/16, but I will.", "Dean? You all right?", "Dean,wake up!", "Sleep well?", "Dean, come on, man. You think I can't see it?", "The nightmares, the drinking. I'm with you 24/7. I know something's going on.", "Uriel wasn't lying, but you are. You remember hell, don't you?", "The truth, Dean. I mean, I'm your brother. I-I just wish you'd talk to me.", "Cute.", "Yeah. And florists on the side.", "Believe us, we do not have it easy.", "But you know what? Maybe that's the whole point, Wes.", "Right, yeah, you get what you want, you get crazy.", "Because that's life, Wes.", "So, tell me about it.", "Dean, look, you can't just shoulder this thing alone. You gotta let me help.", "I know that.", "You're not pissed we're going after the girl, you're pissed Ruby threw us the tip.", "I told you, Dean, she helped me go after Lilith.", "Sure Dean, let's trade stories. You first: how was hell?", "I don't want 10 years. I don't want one year. I don't want candy! I want to trade places with Dean.", "Just take me! It's a fair trade!", "Why not? Lilith wants me dead. Just let Dean go, and she can have me.", "You grabbed a coma patient?", "Why are you here?", "And, uh... what's that?", "You want me to use my psychic whatever.", "Skip the speech. I'm ready. Let's go.", "So let's kill her.", "Okay. What do you want from me?", "Yeah?", "Hey, I told you I was coming clean.", "Yeah, well, there's more to the story.", "Ruby?", "What about...", "Where\u2019s Bobby?", "Is He working a job?", "Now that's seared in my brain.", "She was convinced that he wasn't her real daddy.", "Dude, you're confusing reality with porn again. Look, Anna didn\u2019t say, she just kept repeating that this real father of hers was mad. Like very mad, like wanted to kill her mad.", "I'm right here.", "Dude. Reality. Porn.", "Who?", "I heard him.", "Dean, I'm damn curious. But you're not talking about hell, and I'm not pushing.", "What?", "Oh, my God.", "Dean... Dean, look, you held out for 30 years. That's longer than anyone would have.", "What are you doing?", "Like you're looking for a job.", "It's probably a dumbwaiter. All these old houses had them.", "What?", "You said...", "Never mind.", "Think it got left behind?", "We could tell them the truth.", "No, not really.", "You were in Hell, Dean. But maybe you did what you did there... but you're not them. They were barely human.", "What?", "That's Jeb Dexter.", "He's famous, kind of.", "It's not all crap.", "Okay, that was crap but that\u2019s not all magicians. It takes skill.", "Dude, I was thirteen. It was a phase.", "What are you doing here, Ruby?", "I'm working a job.", "You got something against magic?", "What? No. You?", "Yeah, we-we came to the convention \u2018cos we thought we could learn somethin\u2019.", "It\u2019s a brother act.", "Do you think we will?", "Die before we get old.", "You know what I mean, Dean. I mean, do you think we'll still be chasing demons when we're 60.", "There's Bobby.", "I just wish there was a way we could go after the source, that's all. Cut the head off the snake.", "He slipped me.", "He\u2019s a magician.", "Wow, it\u2019s like a magic museum.", "Having fun?", "Right. Nice shorts.", "No.", "Little help.", "She was a stripper?", "Rough night?", "You seem pretty cheery.", "I just talked to Bobby. We officially have a theory.", "Siren.", "What do you think? She infects the men during sex?", "Just take him to the strip club, keep an eye out for the siren. Come on, Dean. Just, just focus on the naked girls. You'll forget he's even there.", "No?", "Dude, I'm not under her spell", "What?", "No, say it.", "You poisoned him.", "That so.", "Oh yeah, what secrets?", "So I need your say-so to make a phone call?", "None of your business.", "Okay, fine, you wanna know why I didn\u2019t tell you about Ruby? And how we\u2019re hunting down Lilith? Because you\u2019re too weak to go after her, Dean. You\u2019re holding me back. I\u2019m a better hunter than you are. Stronger, smarter; I can take out demons you\u2019re too scared to go near.", "You\u2019re too busy sitting around feeling sorry for yourself, whining about all the souls you tortured in Hell, boo-hoo... You\u2019re not standin\u2019 in my way, anymore!", "Dean, look, you know I didn\u2019t mean the things I said back there, right? That it was just the Sirens spell talking?", "Okay. So... so we\u2019re good?", "What?", "How so?", "Look, I-I don't want them to die either Dean, but there's a... natural order.", "What?", "Yeah but the normal rules don't really apply to us. Do they?", "You have no idea.", "How you doing?", "You want some aspirin?", "Got no idea.", "What? Dean, I'm not keeping secrets.", "Dean, reapers are invisible, the only people who can see them are the dead and the dying.", "Yeah?", "You do have a concussion.", "It is crazy.", "Well, Pamela, you are a sight for sore eyes.", "Get out of me.", "I don't know. Learn some ghost moves?", "Dude, I'm not gonna do Fight Club with a 12-year-old.", "Go to Hell.", "We just got back from Pamela's funeral.", "I\u2019m stronger than that now. Now I can kill.

I just wanna ask you one question.", "I just can't shake this feeling like I... like I don't belong here. You know what I mean? Like I should do something more than sit in a cubicle.", "Okay. Did you just call me \"Sammy\"?", "I think you did. Yeah. Don't.", "You got me.", "As in... Sam slash Dean. Together.", "Yeah.", "Doesn't seem to matter.", "Well, we're hoping that our article can... shine a light on an under-appreciated series.", "We think you're probably just psychic.", "There's gotta be something this guy's not telling us.", "Stop it.", "[turns away from Dean]", ".....", "[turns back to Dean] Guy's good.", "Well, it frustrates me when you'd rather hide than fight.", "You think I'll do it, don't you? You think I'll go darkside.", "... What else did he tell you?", "It's not what you think...", "Maybe he slipped one past the goalie.", "Dean, look maybe...", "He lost his mother. Maybe we can understand what that feels like.", "Because...", "Dad's dead, Dean.", "Alright, we've closed off every other way into the house. If this thing's coming, it's coming through here.", "I'll take that as a compliment.", "Who\u2019s me?", "I went for a Coke.", "You have to come with us.", "Don't you get it? Forever. The demons will never stop. You can never be with your family. So, you either get as far away from them as possible. Or you put a bullet in your head, And that's how you keep your family safe. But there's no getting out and there's no going home.", "I got a little dizzy.", "What do you want me to say about it Dean?", "I'm scaring myself.", "You saw what I did, come on, stop the car, take a swing!", "Then scream, chew me out!", "Alright. So, uh, what's the big demon problem?", "I'm not drinking the demon blood for kicks. I'm getting strong enough to kill Lilith.", "I'm losing my mind.", "What do you want?", "I tried, I did. It didn't pan out that way. Sorry kid.", "Look, they killed Jessica.", "I know.", "I'm sorry, I am, but life doesn't turn out the way you thought it would when you were 14 years old. We were never gonna be normal, we were never gonna get away. Grow up.", "No", "You won't shoot me Bobby.", "You won't do it. (walks forward until Bobbby's gun is pressed to his stomach) You can't do it.", "(places one hand on the barrel of the gun and raises it to his heart) Then shoot.", "Stop bossing me around, Dean! Look, my whole life you take the wheel, you call the shots, and I trust you because you are my brother. Now, I am asking you, for once, trust me.", "Yes, I do!", "Why? Look I'm telling you-", "What? No. Say it!", "You don't know me. You never did, and you never will.", "Where's Lilith?", "Yeah, you are, actually. And with good reason.", "I've been waiting for this for a very long time.", "Ruby, what's going on?", "What? What-what did I do?", "No, no, no-he, eh Lilith. I stopped her. I killed her!", "Oh my god.", "He's coming...", "Becky, does he know where it is?", "Uh, are you sure you got that right?", "Um... Becky, can- uh... can you quit touching me?", "You guys warned me about Ruby, the demon blood, but I didn't listen. I brought this on.", "I'm sorry.", "Dean... is there something you wanna say to me?", "I would give anything, anything, to take it all back-", "What can I do?", "Dean-", "No, listen, this is important. I know you don't trust me. Just, now I realize something. I don't trust me either. From the minute I saw that blood, the only thought in my head... And I tell myself it's for the right reasons, that my intentions are good, and it- it feels true, you know? But I think, underneath... I just miss the feeling. I know how messed up that sounds, which means, I know how messed up I am... The thing is, the problem\u2019s not the demon blood, not really, I mean, I- what I did, I can't blame the blood, or Ruby, or... anything. The problem's me. How far I'll go. There's something in me that... scares the hell outta me, Dean. In the last couple of days, I caught another glimpse.", "I'm in no shape to be hunting. I need to step back, 'cause I'm dangerous. Maybe it's best if we just go our separate ways.", "I was expecting a fight.", "I'm sorry, Dean.", "It's okay. Take care of yourself, Dean.", "Jessica? I'm dreaming.", "I miss you, so much.", "What do you mean?", "No. It's different now.", "Last time, I wanted to be normal. This time... I know I'm a freak.", "No.", "No.", "No!", "Why are you here, Jess?", "From what?", "Well don't worry, because I won't make that mistake again.", "Riddle wrapped inside an enigma wrapped inside a taco?", "It's true. What the demon said, it's all true.", "Why? You gonna hate me any less? Am I gonna hate myself any less? What do you want?", "I did it. I started the apocalypse.", "[to \"Jessica\"] God knows how much I miss you too. But you're wrong. People can change.

I can. I'm gonna prove it to you.", "Dean, it does not have to be like this, we can fight it.", "Dean, don't do this.", "What made you change your mind?", "Thank you. Really, thank you. I won't let you down.", "So what do we do now?", "Guess we have no choice.", "So... what's with this job?", "Yeah, definitely, um, but... we've got bigger problems, don't you think?", "[referring to \"Little Bastard\"] So, what... this is like, Christine?", "[kneels down and looks under the car] Need a flashlight?", "Y--uh... okay...", "I've been working my ass off here...", "That's not the point.", "Look, I'm just saying.

Jesse is the devil's son?", "So we tell him the truth. You say Jesse's destined to go darkside, fine, but he hasn't yet.

He takes the story really seriously.", "Oh, hey, Chuck, look. If you really want to publish more books, I guess that's okay with us.", "No, not really. We have guns and we will find you.", "Dean\u2014", "Last words?", "Yeah, me too.", "Hey!

Please... just... could you give me a second chance?", "Thank you.", "The wraith-", "She was right.", "Most of the time I can hide it, but I am angry. I'm mad at everything.

Nothing about that has changed, nothing ever will. So right now, what I need, is for you to climb down out of my ass. Can you do that? Will you do that for me, honey? Will you please, just once, get off my ass, you know? I'd appreciate it, I really would.", "What?", "Brother-in-law.", "Where did you hear that?", "Because somehow it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.", "I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass and ceramic. So there's that.", "You didn't follow my instructions!", "I don't know. But you gotta convince me and you're going nowhere until you do.", "Do you want to... [motions for Krazy-8 to turn around so he can unlock the chain. Krazy-8 turns around] So you're not angry?", "That's very understanding.", "Me too.", "The moment I do, are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?", "I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...", "I don't know. Just...doesn't it seem like...something's missing?", "The soul? There's nothing but chemistry here.", "I have cancer. Lung cancer. It's bad.", "You can't be serious. What the hell are you doing here?", "Who sent you? You wearing a wire? You setting me up?", "So who did you tell about\u2013", "Then why are you here?", "Touch base?", "Wow, that's...that's what you think we need, to debrief?", "Everybody digs...the meth we cooked.", "Great.", "Get the hell off my property.", "Go and don't come back. Now!", "I just think that we need to...discuss it a little more, that's all.", "Well, there's the money discussion. $90,000 out of pocket. Maybe more.", "Alright. Skyler, say that there is a way, and we spend all that money, and...am I supposed to leave you with all that debt? I just don't want emotions ruling us. Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.", "Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name. Schwartz: black. Walter White. So together, they became Gray Matter Technologies.", "Well, no. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott. I gravitated toward education.", "Alright, I've got the Talking Pillow now. Okay? We all, in this room, love each other. We want what's best for each other and I know that. I am very thankful for that. But...what I want...what I want, what I need, is a choice.", "Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own. Choices, I mean. My entire life it just seems I never...you know, had a real say about any of it. Now this last one, cancer...all I have left is how I choose to approach this.", "Of course I do. Skyler, you've read the statistics. These doctors...talking about surviving. One year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters. But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love? For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house. I want to sleep in my own bed. I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day, lose my hair, and lie around too tired to get up...and so nauseated that I can't even move my head. And you cleaning up after me? Me, with...some dead man, some artificially alive...just marking time? No. No. And that's how you would remember me. That's the worst part. So...that is my thought process, Skyler. I'm sorry. I just...I choose not to do it.", "Wanna cook?", "Let's get something straight. This \u2013 the chemistry \u2013 is my realm. I am in charge of the cooking. Out there on the street, you deal with that. As far as our customers go, I don't want to know anything about them. I don't need to see them. I don't want to hear from them. I want no interaction with them whatsoever. This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner. You got any issues with that?", "No matter what happens, no more bloodshed. No violence.", "Tell you what?", "How did you know?", "3-A.", "Your aunt...How bad was she when they caught it?", "How long?", "You got a problem with that?", "We have to move our production bulk wholesale now.

You have to take two.", "Fulminate of mercury. A little tweak of chemistry.", "Because it was illegal.", "What's wrong with it? It's private.", "Yeah, so...so where do you transact business? Enlighten me.", "We're not going to need pseudoephedrine. We're going to make phenylacetone in a tube furnace, then we're going to use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine. Four pounds.", "No pseudo.", "In World War II, the Germans had an artillery piece \u2013 it's the biggest in the world \u2013 called the Gustav Gun, and it weighed a thousand tons. And the Gustav was capable of firing a seven-ton shell and hitting a target, accurately, twenty-three miles away. [chuckles] I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without every disabling it. But, drop a commando \u2013 one man, with just a bag of this \u2013 and he could melt right through four inches of steel and destroy that gun forever.", "So yes, I think it'll cut through any lock we're likely to find.", "We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure.", "Tuco.

I mean, that should put a dent in it, anyway. 24K a year provides for, say, ten years. That's $240,000, plus 360 plus 137...737. $737,000, that's what I need. That is what I need. You and I both clear about 70 grand a week. That's only ten and a half more weeks. Call it eleven. Eleven more drug deals and always in a public place from now on. It's doable.

We tried to poison you because you are an insane, degenerate piece of filth and you deserve to die.", "Let him bleed.", "There was no fugue state. I remember everything. The truth is I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house. I just had to...get out. And so I left. I didn't think about it, I just did it.

It's more than an assistant. Partners. We'd be partners again. Split everything, 50/50, just like before. 1.5 million dollars. Each.", "I don't think you heard me.", "You understand this: you are turning down one and a half million dollars.", "Your meth is good, Jesse. As good as mine.", "Let me ask you something, do you remember when we were out in the desert with Tuco?", "You knew. You knew my brother-in-law was with the DEA.", "He is not a problem for us or our business, but your being here...is this some sort of message?", "No, listen, I, uh...this attack on my brother-in-law, I don't understand it, I don't know what it means. Please, if you may have some knowledge that you can share with me. I fear for my family.", "My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him. I believe that same person was protecting me. Those two men \u2013 the assassins \u2013 I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law. Because of this intervention, I am alive, and yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout, not a silent assassination. In one stroke, he bloodied both sides, set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be enormous. We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life, and more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same. One issue which troubles me: I don't know what happens when our three month contract ends.", "You know why I do this. I want security for my family.", "How did you come up with that? I mean, where did you possibly...?", "There's been a contamination.", "Something got into the lab.", "No, no, it's not that kind of contaminant.", "Not to us, particularly, no.", "This is, uh, I made it.", "...Fly.", "I mean, a fly. A housefly.", "It got into the lab and I'm trying to get it out, okay? Understand?", "[scoffs] Ebola.", "Thank you, I know what Ebola is.", "Now tell me, what would a West African virus be doing in our lab, hm?", "Okay, look, we're running late, so let's just get started. The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done.", "What are you doing?", "Have you not heard a word I said? No cooking until this fly is dealt with. Have I been speaking to myself?", "The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant.", "We're making nothing until we catch this fly.", "No, no. It is here. It is around, okay? He's around, and I'm not going to expose this batch to the open air and contamination, period. Now, you can leave to deal with this myself or you can help me. But you're right, we're running out of time. So I need you to answer right now. [Jesse drops the sack and walks off] Okay.", "I've been to my oncologist, Jesse. Just last week. I'm still in remission. I'm healthy.", "No end in sight.", "No. I missed it. There was some perfect moment that passed me right by, but I had to have enough to leave them. That was the whole point. None of this makes any sense if I didn't have enough. And it had to be before she found out. Skyler. It had to be before that.", "I'm saying that I lived too long. You want them to actually miss you. You want their memories of you to be...but she just won't...she just won't understand. I mean, no matter how well I explain it, these days she just has this...this... I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words. There must exist certain words in a certain specific order that can explain all of this, but with her I just can't ever seem to find them.", "You know, I was thinking before the fugue state, but during the fugue state I didn't have enough money, so no, not then. And plus my daughter wasn't born yet. It had to be after Holly was born.", "Definitely before the surgery. Ah Christ, that damn second cell phone. I mean, how could I possibly? [pause] Oh, I know the moment. It was the night Jane died. I was at home and we needed diapers and so I said I'd go, but it was just an excuse. Actually that was the night I brought you your money, remember?", "And afterward I stopped at a bar. It was odd, I never do that \u2013 go to a bar alone. I just walked in, sat down. I never told you.", "I sit down and this man, this stranger, he engages me in conversation. He's a complete stranger. But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis.", "Of course I didn't know it at the time. I mean, he's just some guy in a bar. I just didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news.", "Think of the odds. Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical. I mean, think of the odds of me going in and sitting down that night, in that bar, next to that man.", "Water on Mars. Family.", "I told him that I had a daughter and he told me he had one, too. And he said, \"Never give up on family.\" And I didn't. I took his advice. My God, the universe is random, it's chaos. It's subatomic particles and endless pings, collision \u2013 that's what science teaches us. What does this say? What is it telling us that the very night that this man's daughter dies, it's me who is having a drink with him? I mean, how could that be random?", "No, no, it's, uh... Oh, that was the moment. That night. I should never have left home. Never gone to your house. Maybe things would have... Oh, I was...I was at home watching TV. Some nature program about elephants...and Skyler and Holly were in another room. I can hear them on the baby monitor. She was singing a lullaby. Oh, if I had just lived right up to that moment...and not one second more. That would have been perfect.", "Jesse. Come here. I couldn't chance saying it inside, for all I know the lab's wired for sound. That half a pound that I said we were off by? Now I'm not accusing you, but if \u2013 you understand \u2013 if they ever found out...", "I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you.", "Help me how?", "What advice do you have for me?", "Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?", "What's to find out? It's a dispute over turf, right? I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago? Because back then you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry. Murder is not part of your twelve-step program. This is not some amends that you have to make. What you are talking about here is pointless. This achieves nothing. It accomplishes nothing.", "Jesse, listen to me: you are not a murderer. I am not and you are not. It's as simple as that. [Jesse gets up to leave] Jesse...", "Maybe...What if we, uh...maybe...could you get him arrested?", "No, listen, I know it sounds risky, but it wouldn't be anything that would get him into real trouble, nothing that could lead back to our business. Just some minor offense.", "Not jail, as in jail jail. I'm talking about one of those situations when you're in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway.", "What can I do for you?", "And?", "Why?", "Saul said you've done things like this before.", "OK, so what's the problem?", "Saul?", "What is?", "No.", "Just... just a warning?", "Jesse... [Gus motions for Walter to be quiet]", "Run.", "[answers phone] Yeah?", "Yeah, I see you.", "And then what? I'm gonna need some...some kind of assurance.", "Excuse me?", "Not that I know of, no.", "I'm quite well, thank you.", "My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened.", "That's right, he couldn't. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an 11-year old boy.", "Maybe. Then again maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.", "I would never ask you that.", "I wouldn't know. Couple of time zones away at least. Beyond that I'd only be guessing. He has enough money to last forever. He knows he has to keep moving. You'll never find him.", "He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done, which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man, so if I may, I would like to review options with you, of which, it seems to me, you have two. Option A: you kill me right here and now. Apparently I have made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses, and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him, too. A pointless exercise, it seems to me, but that is option A.", "I continue cooking. You and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer option B.", "How you holding up?", "I got my old job back. At least until they kill me and Gale takes over.", "He's their boy.", "Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process. I try to be as vague as possible but I got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say. Maybe the only thing saving me is Gale's fastidiousness. Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method...", "You know what we do.", "Never the DEA. The cooking can't stop. That's the one thing I'm certain of \u2013 production cannot stop. Gus can't afford to. So if I'm the only chemist that he's got, then I got leverage and leverage keeps me alive, and it keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that. If I'm the only chemist that he's got...", "I'll do it. I'm gonna need your help. I mean, they're watching me day and night. They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don't even know where the man lives. He's not in the phonebook, I can't find him on the Internet, I can't do it in the lab \u2013 Victor's always there. I mean, if I can just shake Victor, even an hour one night, I think then that...I may be able to...make it look like an accident.", "I'm all ears, but when it comes down to you and me versus him, I'm sorry \u2013 I'm truly sorry \u2013 but it's gonna be him.", "Please don't do this. Mike, you don't have to do this.", "I'll cook. I'll cook for free, and there won't be anymore trouble, I promise you...", "...OK, if I could just talk to Gus...", "...I know I could make him understand...", "...Please if I could talk to Gus, I could convince him, OK? Just let me please, please, PLEASE let me talk to him!", "Look, I'll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he's the problem, he's always been the problem and without him, we would...and he's in town, alright? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him. He's right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I'll take you right to him. What do you say?", "I don't know, he moves around, but if you let me call him. [Walter reaches for his phone. Victor reaches for his gun] No, no, please! No, it's just my phone. It's just my phone. I'll call him and I'll have him meet me, OK? OK?", "No, I didn't do it. I can't now. It's gonna have to be you.", "Listen to me. You're closer than we are. You have about a 20 minute lead. They got me at the laundry and they're going to kill me... [Mike and Victor attempt to grab the phone away] Jesse, do it now! Do it! Do it fast! Do it, Jesse! Do it! [Jesse grabs a gun and runs outside. Mike grabs the phone away from Walter]", "You might want to hold off.", "Because your boss is gonna need me. 6353 Juan Tabo, apartment 6. [Gale's address. Mike and Victor look at each other, shocked] Yeah.", "[quietly to Jesse] Bet he forgets the aluminum. Guarantee. Guarantee he forgets. [Victor pauses and thinks] Uh-huh. You don't know what the hell you're doing, do you? You forgot the aluminum. One of the first steps. [Victor grabs a bucket of aluminum and pours it into the batch] Son of a bitch.", "Alright, let's talk about Gale Boetticher. He was a good man and a good chemist and I cared about him. He didn't deserve what happened to him. He didn't deserve it at all. But I'd shoot him again and tomorrow and the next day and the day after that. When you make it Gale versus me, or Gale versus Jesse, Gale loses! Simple as that. This is on you, Gus, not me, not Jesse. I mean really, what'd you expect me to do? Just simply roll over and allow you to murder us? That I wouldn't take measures \u2013 extreme measures \u2013 to defend myself? Wrong! Think again.", "Gus, you do this, all you'll have left is an $8 million hole in the ground. This lab, this equipment, is useless without us, without Jesse and myself. You'll have no new product, you'll have no income. Your people out there won't be paid. Your distribution chain collapses. You'll have nothing. You kill me, you have nothing. You kill Jesse, you don't have me. You won't do this. You're too smart. You can't afford to do this. Please let...let us just go back to work. We're here. Let us work. We're ready to go to work. We'll just pick up right where we left off.", "What do you mean?", "Now, what page is that?", "Yes. Absolutely, defense. Why?", "Yeah, but... if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced?", "It's for defense. [beat] Defense. I'll take it.", "May I buy you a drink? Next round when you're done.", "[to bartender] Another round for him and I'll have the same. No ice. [to Mike] I feel like I need to explain myself. There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand. I didn't want any of this to happen. Everything I did I did out of loyalty to my partner, and then later, of course, purely out of self-defense. I hope you can appreciate that. Just like I appreciated that... [waits for bartender to walk by] ...I appreciated that when you were going to kill me, you were simply following orders. I get that completely. And I harbor no ill will.", "Mike, I'm trying to tell you\u2013", "Hell of a last couple of weeks. Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.", "I mean, I cannot be alone in feeling this way. Not after what happened to Victor.", "Mike, do I have to come right out and say this? Now you and I, we're in the same boat.", "If it happened to Victor, it can happen to you. And what the hell was that anyway? A message? He cuts a man's throat just to send a message?", "Yeah, I got the job, but for how long? Get me in a room with him. Mike, just get me in a room and I'll do the rest.", "Yeah.", "Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.", "[slight pause] Yeah, no, no, no. She's right. Look, do I need to state the obvious? I mean, there's got to be dozens of car washes in this area. Who says it has to be this one?", "Why?", "God...", "What do you mean rude about me?", "What?", "It's this one.", "[toasting to the new car wash where he will launder his drug money] To clean cars...and clean money.", "\"I'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.\"", "Two terribly's?", "OK, I would just never use that word. I would never say the word \"terribly.\"", "And why am I so ashamed?", "I was \u2013 and am \u2013 providing for our family.", "I'm \"weak\", I'm \"out of control\". I mean, this whole thing makes me look like crap.", "How do you look bad exactly? Where is the \"I slept with my boss\" bullet point? Because I can't seem to find that anywhere.", "[jokingly, laughing] Heh. You got me!", "Then what else should I not worry about, Saul, hm? Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets? Should I not worry that my drug-addicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies? You should see his house. It's like skid row! He has actual hobos living there! Now how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk? That guy Mike, that grunting dead-eyed cretin, sucker punching me in the face! I've got Gus wielding a box cutter! I mean...Western Union! Message received! Let me ask you, when did this stop being a business, hm? Why am I the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner?", "[from the bedroom] Hey, son!", "Uh, we're...we're back here. We'll be out in a minute.", "Jesse. Jesse! What happened yesterday? Where were you?", "Picking up what?", "You...guarded Mike? What is this, some kind of a joke?", "What, again? Why?", "Hank, not to tell you your business, but I'm not sure I agree.", "Well, you showed me that notebook and from what I saw \u2013 and this is just my humble opinion \u2013 from what I saw on those papers...genius? Not so much. I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages, so to my eye, all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying, probably of someone else's work. Believe me, I have been around enough students to know. So this genius of yours, maybe he's still out there.", "[to Skyler] Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!", "Yeah.", "Bogdan. As is. [Bogdan hands over the framed dollar and leaves. Walter smashes the frame open and uses the dollar to buy a soda]", "Alright, I need an update.", "An update on these little field trips that you've been taking with Mike.", "And you're his bodyguard, right? [Jesse turns away] What? What? That's what you said!", "And this has to be you? It can't be \u2013 I don't know \u2013 Tyrus or any of the couple dozen muscleheads that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman. Why? What, is there something about you I don't know? Are you a former Navy SEAL? Do you have to have your hands registered as lethal weapons?", "All I'm saying is that do you not even question this? Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting, I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.", "I mean, what if it...Oh God... [Walter thinks] I mean, what if it...What if it's all just a set-up?", "What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real? I mean, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike, he steps out for one second and what happens? You immediately get robbed.", "Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me. He knows that I won't stand for it. He needs me and he hates the fact that he needs me! So what does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me!", "Wait a minute, how long did those guys chase you, huh? 'Cause the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy. No, no, this whole thing \u2013 all of this \u2013 it's all about me.", "This was my idea. Don't punish them. You tell Gus to blame me, not them.", "[on phone] Yes, hello. I need a cab...Yes, thank you. The name is White...I'm at the Vavillion parking lot near University...Oh yes, that's right, just south of the airport....Oh, that would be great, thank you. Oh, how long do you think that will take? [The Dodge Challenger explodes] No, I'm sure he'll see me. Thank you.", "A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us, and now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as...what? An assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he playing? Does he think you're that naive? He can't truly think that you'd forget. Let alone Gale, let alone Victor, and all the horror that goes along with all of that, what about this girlfriend of yours? And her little brother? I mean, the man looked you straight in the eye and told you no more children, but that very night, that little boy...he just, he winds up...I mean, Gus can't possibly think that you'd forget that. All I'm saying is that is it possible that he would think that you're that weak-willed...", "You'll do what?", "That is such bullshit.", "Never give up control. Live life on your own terms.", "To hell with your cancer. I've been living with cancer for the better part of a year. Right from the start, it's a death sentence. That's what they keep telling me. Well, guess what? Every life comes with a death sentence, so every few months I come in here for my regular scan, knowing full well that one of these times \u2013 hell, maybe even today \u2013 I'm gonna hear some bad news. But until then, who's in charge? Me. That's how I live my life.", "I've got some math for you: Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us!", "Uh, Hank, uh, I mean, it sounds great, really does, but y'know, I won't lie, you caught me somewhat...indisposed.", "Yeah, that's...embarrassingly, that's it. Y'know, it's just upset stomach and everything. It's out of control...really explosive. Bad Tex-Mex at the mall.", "Should I even ask?", "So, what? Is this going to be a regular thing now? Meth cooking and corpse disposal? Jesus...", "What was it this time? What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus? Or did Gus just need to send another message?", "No. Could I sit down?", "Word has come down?", "So you saw Gus?", "You didn't see Gus.", "Then who told you all of that?", "Passed down? By whom?", "So \"they\" doesn't include Gus. You haven't been with Gus, you haven't seen Gus, you haven't spoken to Gus.", "You weren't at Gus' house last night?", "[Taking out the ricin cigarette] It's still here. It's still here. [Walter throws the ricin cigarette at Jesse] You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.", "Yeah.", "2 hours and 18 minutes and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.", "YOU LYING LITTLE SHIT! You had one thing to do, one thing! That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives. And you were right there. You were in the house and you didn't have the guts to do it!", "You never had any intention of killing him, did you?", "This. This is how I knew. [tosses the GPS tracker to Jesse]", "7:10 to 9:28 pm. 2 hours and 18 minutes. But you had no intentions, did you? Not the slightest intention.", "Oh ho!", "I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me? What you've done for me?! You've killed me is what you've done! You signed my death warrant! And now you want advice? Alright, I'll give you advice: go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will and wind up in a barrel somewhere!", "Yeah.", "I wish I could take back last night. It was your birthday; this shouldn't be on your mind.", "No, it's not OK. I'm your father. I don't want last night to be... I mean, you really... you can't think of me like...", "My father died when I was six. You knew that, right?", "He had Huntington's disease. It destroys portions of the brain, affects muscle control, and leads to dementia. It's just a nasty disease. It's genetic. Terrified my mother that I might have it, so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean. My father fell very ill when I was four, five. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My, heh, my mother would tell me so many stories about my father. I mean, she would talk about him all the time. I knew about his personality, how he treated people, I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked: medium rare, just like you. I knew things about my father, I had a lot of information. It was because people would tell me these things. They would paint this picture of my father for me and I always pretended that was who I saw too, that I remembered. But it was all a lie. In truth, I only have one real, actual memory of my father. It must have been right before he died. My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him. And I remember the smell in there. The chemicals. It was as if they used every single cleaning product they could find in a fifty mile radius, like they didn't want you smelling the sick people. There was this stench of Lysol and bleach, you could just feel it coating your lungs. Anyway, there, lying on the bed, is my father. And he's all... he's all twisted up. My mom, she puts me on her lap, she's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him, but really he just scares me. And he's looking right at me, but I can't even be sure he knows who I am. And your grandmother is talking, trying to be cheerful as she does, but the only thing I could remember is him breathing. There was this... this rattling sound, like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can. Like there was nothing in him. Anyway, that is the only real memory that I have of my father. I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night. I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.", "Or else you'll do what?", "Stay away from Pinkman...or else you'll do...what? Kill me? If you could kill me, I'd already be dead. But you can't. You can't kill me because Jesse wouldn't cook for you if you did. That's it, isn't it? [coughs] No matter how hard you try to turn him against me, to screw with his head, so that he would hate my guts...and he still won't let you do it.", "You can't.", "[panicking] Saul! This man we spoke of before, this, this person that you said could, could disappear me, give me a whole new life, and make sure I'm never found?", "I need him! I need this man now! Saul, Gus is gonna murder my whole family.", "Saul! Now, Saul!", "Alright! Yes, I understand!", "I have got no choice.", "How much?", "I've got the money, now come on! Please!", "What?! This.. this is a vacuum cleaner repair company!", "Where is it? Where's the rest?", "The money, Skyler, where is the rest? Skyler? WHERE IS THE MONEY?!", "What? You did what?", "You gave our money to Beneke?", "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! [Walter collapses crying, then breaks out in crazy laughter, as Skyler backs away to answer the phone]", "Oh Skyler...", "Skyler\u2013", "I have lived under the threat of death for a year now. And because of that, I've made choices.", "Listen to me. I alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else. And those consequences...they're coming. No more prolonging the inevitable.", "I don't know what you're thinking coming here. Aw Christ, what does it matter? Everything, it's all coming to an end. Do you even know what's happening? The full scope of what's happening? They took me out to the desert, they put a hood over my head and drove me out into the desert on my knees. They threatened my family, and not just Hank. My wife, my children... It's just a matter of time now. I was able to protect them for now, but...Gus is gonna make his move and...and I don't know...I don't know when or how. All I know is it's gonna happen. And I'm powerless to stop it.", "Jesse, why? Why, in God's name, would I poison a child?", "I DID NOT DO THIS!", "I'm not, I'm not lying, Jesse, listen to me, listen to me, what would I have to gain, what possible...possible...who...who would...Oh my God... [Walter begins laughing]", "I have been waiting...I've been waiting all day, waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me, and it's you. Who do you know who's OK with using children, Jesse, who do you know? Who's allowed children to be murdered, hm? Gus! He has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn and now the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent, and boy he's got that down, he's got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.", "No! You don't even believe that. Gus' cameras everywhere, please. Listen to yourself. No, he's known everything all along. Where were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? C'mon! Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he's wanted. You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven you can run a lab without me, and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant! So go ahead, if you think that I am capable of doing this, then go... [Walter grabs Jesse's wrist and puts the gun on his own forehead] ...put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.", "DO IT! Do it.", "Do it. Do it.", "Where are you going?", "No, don't, he'll see you coming. You'll die before you get anywhere near him.", "Jesse, Jesse, just get in your car, just go, just drive.", "Then let me help.", "I know you despise me and I know how much you want to see me dead. But I'm willing to bet there's a man that you hate even more. I'm offering you an opportunity for revenge.", "[to Jesse] Gus is dead. We've got work to do.", "How are you doing?", "I'm, uh...I'm doing quite well. I'm good.", "It's over. We're safe.", "I won.", "Hey He-e-e-ey! Hey...", "Uh \u2014 no, sorry. I\u2014", "Welcome home.", "Your uncle is safe, right? How do they know that?", "Wow.", "Ah.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, yeah, I want to. Just\u2014just give me a couple of minutes, eh?", "You going to show...I don't know...some kind of mild relief that I'm alive?", "Scared? Scared of what?", "So what?", "They won't. There's no prints. I made sure of that. There's no paperwork on the truck, the magnet, or the batteries. Untraceable salvage, all of it. I made sure of that, too.", "Yes. It worked.", "Because I say so.", "[to Saul] We're done when I say we're done.", "[to Skyler] I forgive you.", "[beat] Mike, I know you don't care for me. We've had our issues, you and I. But, I would suggest that you leave emotion out of this decision.", "Well, you missed a good meal. The lasagna came out very well, if I do say so myself. I wrapped some up if you'd like some later.", "You know, it gets easier. I promise you that it does. What you're feeling right now. About Ted, everything. It'll pass.", "So what we do, we do for good reasons. And we've got nothing to worry about. And there's no better reason than family.", "[to Saul] There is gold in the streets just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.", "Saul, Mike knows the business. He knows distributors.", "Saul, Mike threatened me. He threatened Jesse. He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning. It's what he does. C'mon. Grow a pair.", "Gus Fring is dead, and he was the threat. He was the danger.", "What blood? Beneke?", "No.", "Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing. Please. You didn't set out to hurt anybody. You made a mistake and things got out of control. But you did what you had to do to protect your family. And I'm sorry, but that doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a human being.", "\"That's that?\" That's what?", "To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's? They spend a day or two, Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?", "No, I'll tell you what happens. They come home, to this house, to their parents who love them\u2014", "How many times do I have to say that they are not in\u2014", "What are you going to do to stop it?", "Like what? I mean specifically. What is your next move?", "No, more like you're still struggling. So maybe next time, I have you committed, put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself. Is that what you want?", "I see. So you involve Ted. Ah, well, that'll be fun, bringing the police up to speed on all of that. But not as much as telling your sixteen-year-old son that his father is a wife-beater. Also not a very good plan. What else you got?", "Oh. Now here's the conversation: \"So honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school, but I would love it so much if you would drop everything, leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona.\" Do you have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem. How are you going to save our kids from this \"terrible\" environment?", "What are you going to do? What, are you going to run off to France? Are you going to close the curtains, change the locks? This is a joke. Come on, Skyler! You want to take me on? You want to take away my children? What\u2019s the plan?", "Wait for what? What are you waiting for?", "[to Skyler] See this watch? It\u2019s a birthday present. The person who gave me this wanted me dead, too. Not that long ago, he pointed a gun right between my eyes right here and he threatened to kill me. He changed his mind about me, Skyler. And so will you.", "No, go ahead.", "Well, Jesse, it's your idea, you want to fill him in?", "Are you sure?", "What's going on?", "It's me. Open up.", "Come on, Junior. I'm not going to ask twice.", "You know what.", "We're not kicking you out of anywhere, son. We love you, and this is your house as much as it is ours. But your mom and I need some time alone, and you know that. We explained that to you.", "This is not going to be a debate.", "Because we're your parents and you are our child. That's reason enough. Now please, do as I ask. Now.", "I don't accept that. You're my wife.", "I think you've seen too many movies. [sighs] Our children are not in danger.", "Have you heard of a company called Grey Matter? Well, I cofounded it in grad school with a couple of friends. Actually, I was the one who named it. And back then, it just, oh, small time. We had a couple of patents pending, but nothing Earth-shattering. Of course, we all knew the potential. Hell, we were gonna take the world by storm. And then, well, something happened between the three of us. I'm not going to go into detail, but for personal reasons I decided to leave the company. And I sold my share to my two partners. I took a buyout for $5,000. Now at the time, it was a lot of money for me. Care to guess what that company is worth now?", "Billions. With a 'B.' 2.16 billion as of last Friday. I look it up every week. And I sold my share, my potential, for $5,000. I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.", "Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business.

So it's OK for you to steal my...", "Mike!", "Mike, let me cook it! I'll double your five and you still walk!", "Mike, you need to listen to me.", "Everybody wins.", "The methylamine isn\u2019t coming.", "I\u2019m the man who\u2019s keeping it.", "Mike doesn\u2019t know where it is; only I do. And you\u2019re dealing with me now, not him.", "That thousand gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours \u2013 or anyone else's even, for that matter. But I need distribution.", "That\u2019s right. So if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead, I\u2019ll give you 35% of the take.", "I know all about your operation. See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that\u2019s 70% pure, if you\u2019re lucky. What I produce, is 99.1% pure.", "So, it's grade-school T-ball versus the New York Yankees. Yours is just some tepid, off-brand, generic cola. What I'm making is Classic Coke.", "Do you really want to live in a world without Coca-Cola?", "My partner tells me that your crew switched to a P2P cook because of our success. You dye your meth with food coloring to make it look like mine. You already ape my product at every turn. But now, you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.", "A better high means customers pay more. A higher purity means a greater yield. That\u2019s $130 million of profit that isn\u2019t being pissed away by some sub-standard cook. Now you listen to me. You\u2019ve got the greatest meth cook in Am \u2013 no, the two greatest meth cooks in America \u2013 right here. And with our skills, you\u2019ll earn more from that 35% than you ever would on your own.", "Mike is retiring from our crew. So his share of the partnership is available, if you can handle his end: distribution. And if you give him $5 million of the $15 million that you brought today. Just think of it as a finder\u2019s fee for bringing us together. We have 40 pounds of product ready to ship. Ready to go. Are you ready?", "You know. You all know exactly who I am. Say my name.", "Yeah you do. I'm the cook. I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.", "You sure?", "That's right. Now say my name.", "You're goddamn right.", "Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.", "Uh, look, you know what I think we need to talk about? Doubling down.", "Mm-hmm. Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50. As in, starting a new lab \u2013 a lab that you'll run. A cook all of your own. Why not? You deserve it. You're every bit as good as me. Well, what do you think?", "Jesse, this... what we do... being the best at something is a very rare thing. You don't just toss something like that away. And what? You want to squander that potential \u2013 your potential? Why? To do what?", "Think. To do what, Jesse?", "Look at you. What have you got in your life? Nothing. Nobody. Oh wait, yes \u2013 video games and go-carts. Oh, and when you get tired of that, what then? Huh? And how soon will you start using again? Look, I know how upset you are about what happened to this boy. I am just as upset as you are.", "How can you say that to me? Jesus! I mean, I'm the one who's a father! What, am I gonna curl up in a ball in tears in front of you, or am I gonna lock myself in a room and get high to prove it to you? What happened to that boy was a tragedy and it tears me up inside. But because it happened, am I supposed to just lie down and die with him? It's done! It makes me sick that it happened, just like everyone else who has died in our wake. What Todd did... you and I have done things that are just as bad.", "All the people that we've killed \u2013 Gale... and the rest.

Now that we're in control, no one else gets hurt.", "Wow, oh, that's some kind of logic right there, Mike. You screw up, get yourself followed by the DEA and now suddenly this is all my fault? Why don't you walk me through this, Mike?", "I just...I just realized that Lydia has the names. I can get 'em from her. I'm sorry, Mike. This...this whole thing could have been avoided\u2013", "Mmm hmm.", "He's gone.", "We? Who's we? There is no we anymore. I'm the only vote left. And I'll handle it.", "So?", "Not just now.", "I think this will play just fine. I'm not thirsty. So let's take a look at the list.", "Lydia, I've come all this way. You do have the list?", "Good.", "And why is that?", "I see. Then I suggest you pick up a pen.", "It was my understanding that attending to these nine names was precisely what you wanted.", "Yes, ten, counting the lawyer. So...what? Am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit?", "So you put that list in my hands, and in your mind, I immediately just murder you? Just right here, in this restaurant...", "...Right here in this public place, immediately?", "Listen, Lydia. You made me promise on my children's lives that I guarantee your safety.", "Oh, yeah?", "Marking trees?", "Huh...sounds nice, being out in the woods all day.", "How much is this?", "Heh. You got me.", "Hello, Carol.", "Well, it\u2019s good to see you up and about.", "How you feeling?", "Have you\u2026 Did you get to see a doctor? I mean, when one of these things last more than three days, you really should get that checked.", "Um. Good, good to hear.", "When I heard you weren\u2019t going in to work, I\u2026 Well, looks like you have the work coming to you. Perks of being the boss, huh?", "Good. Yeah, really good. Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?", "No one else got sick, so you probably shouldn\u2019t worry about it. Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear that you\u2019re felling better. Which reminds me, I better get back to it. If there\u2019s anything I can do\u2026", "Feel better.", "You know. You're going to laugh, but I have to ask you... about this.", "Believe it or not, I found this on my car. I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it? Back when we were tracking him, just the two of us. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank?", "You okay? I gotta say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.", "Hank.", "Calm down.", "Listen to me.", "Hank, look... I don't\u2013I don't know where this is coming from Hank, but\u2013", "Let's take a breath, okay? Just listen to yourself. These wild accusations, they could destroy our family! And for what?", "Hank, my cancer is back.", "I'm sorry you feel that way. I wanna beat this thing. I do. I\u2019m back on chemo, and I am fighting like hell. But the truth is in six months you won\u2019t have someone to prosecute.

Hank knows, that is not nothing.", "Always what?", "Belize?", "Saul, you better not be saying what I think you're saying.", "Hank is family.", "You understand that?", "Jesus, what is wrong with you?", "Jesus, send him to Belize. I'll send you to Belize.", "Does that make you happy?", "Just tell me. I know you talked with Hank. I know you made a deal. Skyler, I'll make this easy. I'll give myself up if you promise me one thing: you keep the money. Never speak of it, never give it up. You pass it on to our children, give them everything. Will you do that? Please? Please, don't let me have done all this for nothing.", "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead\u2013 murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time \u2013 something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange \u2013 uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" \u2013 on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.", "What are you talking about?", "Jesse, I am not working you.", "Saul\u2019s guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn\u2019t take long, and when he does, I\u2019m gonna\u2026 I\u2019m gonna talk to him.

The things I have seen... The times I have wanted to tell you...", "Have you never seen something so mad, so extraordinary... That just for one second, you think there might be more out there?", "It would last them for years, then.", "What is this, Scooby-Doo?! Absolutely not!", "College canteen. Rhys is sitting opposite me telling stupid jokes.", "Kissing in the supermarket. The look on his face.", "The way he looks at me sometimes, as if he's scared of what he feels for me.

Who'd assassinate a student?", "Yeah, I think you just cracked it.", "Okay, meanwhile, back at Torchwood...", "We're not postponing the wedding. No way.", "It matters to me!! It's not about the money, Rhys. I want to marry you! Today. Whatever happens. If the skies suddenly fills full of spaceships, or an army of Weevils climbs out of the drains on St. Mary's Street, you fool! Do you not understand what I'm saying, Rhys Williams? All I want to do today is marry you. That's all I want to do.", "What will you do while I'm gone?", "What?", "[surprised] Where?", "You did stand-up?", "Alright...

I'm a very sexy lady and you are a very lucky man. Just remember that, okay? [unzips jacket]", "We could so some practising.", "Sorry?", "Because if I don't...", "Ianto, hi. I'm sorry.

Just sit here?", "I only took them home for a bit of fun.", "Yeah.", "There's one thing I always wanted to ask Jack. Back in the old days. I wanted to know about that Doctor of his. The man who appears out of nowhere and saves the world; except sometimes he doesn't. All those times in history where there was no sign of him \u2026 I wanted to know why not. But I don't need to ask anymore. I know the answer now: Sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame. I'm recording this in case anyone ever finds it, so you can see. You can see how the world ended.", "The threat still stands.", "My husband is still out there with everything you've done recorded on his laptop. One word from me, and he will release that information to the public.", "We can try.", "I can't tell you.", "Right now, I need you to drive this car, and if I told you...", "Oh, thank you.

Can't imagine.", "Welcome to Torchwood.", "This lemonade. This lemonade's flat.", "What? Fizzy, fizzy lemonade?", "Hmm...Just about sums it up.", "And you could feel everything that happened? It still hurt?", "[laughs] I have no idea what any of that means.", "What's ancillary?", "I was thinking that... If this had happened a bit sooner...", "...He'd still be here. Ianto.", "I'm sorry.", "So listen, Category One is bad, yes?", "You watching?", "This is the truth for the whole world to see. We let our government build concentration camps.

Otherwise you'd get out of the car, knock me out and turn the car around.", "I phoned a hundred times. There's no reply. They've got them.", "Why do you always keep thinking you can tell me what to do?", "Don't cock this up, okay?", "Yeah, there's a cursor. They're there.", "Tell them they can have me too.", "Nothing.", "There's just nothing now.", "My mother's name is Mary. Mary! You've known me all this time and you can't remember her name?", "Yeah, well, you should be, because this is all your fault. They want to kill you, but why do they want to do that?", "What have you done?", "Well you've done something haven't you? Way back when in that long bloody life of yours. God, you've lived so long you can't remember half of it! Now you think. Think! What the hell have you done?", "It's me.", "It's me. I caused this. I made this happen. I knew Torchwood was toxic, right from the moment I joined up, the very first day, but I stayed.", "Stop being so nice. We left nice behind a hundred miles back. I'm trying to be honest, okay? Because do you know what the worst thing is of all? Out of all the shit we have seen, all the bloodshed, all the horror...You know what is worse than all that? I loved it. I bloody loved it. And I'd keep telling Rhys I was sorry, and I'd say to little Anwen I'm sorry, but I loved it so much. I knew things no one else knew and, oh, I felt so special. And when we lost people, it was so, so big, and I could say it was worth it. Because the bigger it was, the more important I was. And the more people we lost, the more that meant I was a survivor...and I was better than them. My God, this is all my fault and now they've got my beautiful little girl and I wished this on her.", "That's what I'm saying. Have you got what I'm saying to you, Jack? What I'm saying is, no more! Because I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking, Jack; \"She won\u2019t do this, not really. Not my Gwen.\" \"No, Gwen, she can\u2019t hurt me. Gwen loves me. She\u2019d never harm me.\" And, well, this is about my daughter. And I swear for her sake, I will see you killed like a dog right in front of me if it means her back in my arms. Understood?", "Understood. I feel like I know you now better than I've ever done before.", "Mmm. Right at the end.", "You're gonna live.", "I meant every word I said.", "Good.

Harry Bosco.", "What, can't you search him?", "I don't care. I'll do it.", "I don't know. Which city is it?", "Are you kidding me? Is that right?", "But what does it mean?", "A line through the world?", "So this is what we're doing? A mission on both sides of the world?", "Suppose it is, yeah.", "No way.", "Idiot. You idiot. You told me that was healed. You're not better at all, are you? Let me see.", "It's okay. I got you. Okay, I got you. I got you.", "It's all right. Don't be sorry. I've got you. Okay, let me take a look. Oh, honestly. [rips off his bandage] Oh, God.", "If I had known it was this bad, Jack, you'd never have come.", "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I got you.", "You're not dying. Don't say that.", "It's your blood. No wonder it's killing you. I think, I think it's showing us the way. It's The Blessing. It's somewhere over there. And I think whatever it is, it's calling you, Jack.", "Rex? Oh my God. And Esther?", "Just glad to hear you're alive.", "So the Blessing absorbed the blood, copied it like a new template. So, the system changed its setting.", "But you ruined the world out there!", "Yeah, with no room for the poor, the weak or the ones that don't fit in.", "Oh, great.

She is not for you.", "Not for you!", "I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion. [resumes eating]", "Let's see...[rolls dice] Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.", "...Okay, get this. [Penny and Leonard exchange looks of annoyance] It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts. Because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.", "Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more... I'm not sure what's tripping you up.", "No, you're wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a Notary Public. From time to time, I notarized banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren't just rich. They are Richie Rich rich.", "About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck. ($18.5 billion)", "In fact, I have 61 of them.

I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.", "You're being impossible!", "Fine! Amy, will you be my girlfriend?", "Alright, that's enough about it. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date!", "Congratulations, the Newcomb Medal...Oh, please. That's a scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.", "My point.", "I help the weak. It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman.", "[to Penny] You're right, the tiara was too much.", "Coins lodged in body-parts is not amusing.

[She sits down] Amy, when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time.

That's from the first Spider-Man movie.", "Good. Now, I assume we're splitting the check?", "This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.", "Yeah, of course you do. You\u2019re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.", "It\u2019s not fair. Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.", "Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.", "Wrong.

That\u2019s just yucky. Don\u2019t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that\u2019s true.

I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it\u2019s weird?", "Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you\u2019re up, we could talk.", "Oh, I don\u2019t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend? Yeah, pick one, your choice.", "Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.", "Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today\u2019s North Korea, he\u2019s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.", "Oh, very well. I can\u2019t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.", "Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I\u2019m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?", "Homeostasis refers to a system\u2019s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.", "My point is, I don\u2019t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we\u2019re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo.

You clear on the shampoo issue?", "[Turns to go, then stops] Penny?", "...Please don\u2019t hurt my friend.", "[turns to leave, but turns back] Coconut, what were you thinking? Are you a hula girl now?", "Oh, in fact, she has.

I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.", "I know.", "Wait. I'm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.", "So with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?", "That's rude.", "Oh! Ow! Blueberry in my nose! Blueberry in my nose!", "Play, play, play!", "Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Ugh, he must be wearing a tin foil hat or something.", "Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back!", "Oh, of course! It only works on the weak-minded.", "My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant, invisible cow.", "I'm sorry, 294 is my parking spot.", "I don't use my nipples either, maybe they should reassign those.", "How can you sleep? I\u2019m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.", "Yes. All over it.", "Now you\u2019re being a responsible patient. [he picks up the tub of VapoRub and sits on the couch opposite Amy] Now, you may notice some tingling...", "But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.", "You can\u2019t talk, you\u2019re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa\u2019s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?", "My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.", "Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn't bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of \u2018em. And now you\u2019re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today\u2019s not your day. I\u2019m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!", "Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?", "Well, that snuck up on us, didn\u2019t it?", "Let\u2019s not call it a problem. Let\u2019s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.", "You don\u2019t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don\u2019t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.", "Now, there\u2019s no need to get defensive. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.", "Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.", "Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don\u2019t hold you responsible for your behavior because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you\u2019re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let\u2019s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.", "So does this fellow, but he can\u2019t without it burning like hot soup.", "Yes.", "I read his research; it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist in the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It's his mommy! [starts crying]", "What do we have to lose?", "I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor. [Amy lets go] Why did you stop?! [Amy hugs him again]", "Of course.", "That's awfully personal.", "Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.", "Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.", "Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others\u2014handshaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would've been unthinkable.", "[long pause] It's a possibility.", "Oh, yeah.", "One vintage Mister Mxyzptlk action figure.

Ah, Leonard and I bought that together. That\u2019s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I\u2019ll keep it.", "I suppose I\u2019ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?", "It took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would go whenever the mood struck him.", "Exactly.", "That would be ideal. If a person like that existed I would sign on no further questions asked.", "Wait. Here who is where?", "Um.", "Um.", "Um.", "Um.", "You can\u2019t live here.", "It\u2019s not the message.", "You did.", "It\u2019s Penny\u2019s fault.", "She doesn't want to live with Leonard so he has to live here again. She\u2019s the snake in our garden. She\u2019s the reason we can\u2019t be happy.", "She is, but when do we get to the part about the streetcars?", "She's remarkable.", "How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress she can't remember \"no tomato\" on my hamburger?", "Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish born, French educated Madame Curie. Co-discover of radioactivity. She was a hero of science until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became full with blood and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work I see no reason why that can't also happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?", "Are you pointing out that California is a community property state and since Howard and Bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?", "Well played. Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.", "It\u2019s simple really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The principle that a physical system exists partially in all of its possible states at once.", "Anyway, um, I realized if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and we don\u2019t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.", "Raj, you\u2019re up.", "It was a map, leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.", "Don\u2019t.", "Or that\u2019s complete poppycock which Amy made that up and it could still be the map.", "I would like to change mine.

Which one do you think it is, matey?", "My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. Remind me to put a gun under my pillow. Or a chain saw.", "Or the chain saw.", "They can't just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.", "You may find this hard to believe, but I didn't have any friends growing up.", "But, um, I did have you. And every day at 4 o\u2019clock you\u2019d come to my house on channel 68 and we\u2019d do science together. If it hadn't been for you, who knows what would have become of me. You know, instead of a world class physicist I could have wound up a hobo \u2026 or a surgeon.", "It\u2019s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.", "Professor Proton, it is an honor to meet you.", "Leonard. Did you hear that? Professor Proton said that I should call me Arthur. That means we\u2019re friends.", ": Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my Mom saying its going to ruin my eyes.", "I am.", "[Knock..knock..knock] Amy? [Knock..knock..knock] Amy? [Knock..knock..knock] Amy?", "Never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.", "Thank-you. Would you go and tell everyone else that because they think otherwise.", "Well, I don\u2019t think our relationship is a joke. I think a horse goes into a bar. Bartender says, \u201cWhy the long face?\u201d That\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.", "Oh my. That\u2019s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.", "And now what?", "I\u2019ve not ruled it out.", "I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it to you, but for me what we have is extremely intimate.", "More? Just look at us. It\u2019s only been three years. Here we are in bed together. [Sitting on it.]", "No, hold on. My Elven magic user and your half-Ork warrior did have a love spell cast on them.

No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don\u2019t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? [Knocks his answer in Morse Code].", "Well, I try.", "Careful Amy. The friend of my enemy\u2019s girlfriend is my enemy.", "Yes. You\u2019re either with me or against me.", "Maybe there\u2019s a third option.", "I\u2019d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.", "Who knows? You said you\u2019d be home yesterday, but came home three days ago. You say you\u2019re taking me to work, but for all I know I\u2019ll end up in a deserted amusement park, or a cornfield maze or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.", "OK. By the way you have something on your shirt.", "Hurts, doesn't it? You know I find myself wondering if anything you every told me is true.", "You say you\u2019re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you.", "All right, I\u2019ll give you that one.", "Amusing. I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.", "Really? The only time I never get picked first for the team and I\u2019m stuck with the liability.", "Well. You sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there. I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Well, personally I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favorite show, not mine. Oh look at little Laura Ingalls eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter, huh. That\u2019s strange since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900\u2019s. [Amy stops smiling.] If I knew this show was about time travel I would have watched it much sooner.", "That\u2019s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone since telephones only existed in large cities at the time. It\u2019s more like Little House on the Preposterous.", "Are you sure? Every time my Dad stayed out all night my Mom put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.", "Well, fine. I\u2019m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me but you may have ruined the whole franchise, except for the fourth one which was bad before you got your mitts on it.", "Thank you.", "Yes.

[Knock..knock..knock] Amy.", "I couldn\u2019t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh speaking of which. Do you want some mutton and coconut milk?", "Boy, I cannot give this stuff away.", "Amy, this isn\u2019t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you\u2019re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions and frankly who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.", "I wasn\u2019t speaking about me. I mean honestly, there\u2019s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humor, you\u2019re funniest kind of humor.", "My point is we\u2019re a couple and I like you for who you are quirks and all.", "I should hope so. I don\u2019t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. [Amy slams the door in his face] Not even a goodbye.

It\u2019s in square centimeters. I read it in square meters. Do you know what that means?", "Amy, I was off by a factor of ten thousand.", "Well they shouldn't have, my calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn\u2019t know about.", "Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky!", "What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder.

Well done. You save the world. Whatever. What for?", "Why are you doing it? What are you trying to protect? What are you fighting for?", "Shut up, I'm talking now, right? You do it so people can live their lives. And there's nothing more important than that. Falling in love, getting married, buying flats, having kids or not. But real life, that's what you're protecting. And if you're starting to think that your shit is more important than real life, then we're not going to last very long here, love.", "I don't question how you defend the world against extraterrestrial infiltration - don't you question my knowledge of the hauling industry, right?", "What do you mean, \"announcements\"? [Gwen looks at him and smiles. Rhys looks confused, but then grins delightedly] Oh, bloody hell no!", "This changes everything.", "Yeah! But three of us in a boat.", "I'll go later; the beans are almost done.", "Took me a while to get used to those things [the filming contacts].", "Yeah. That's why Gwen had 'em.", "Hey, she's pregnant.", "Oh, I'm slapping you, yet!", "How is it ruined?", "You're not getting rid of it!", "It's bloody freezing! My feet!", "[proudly] She's bloody gorgeous.", "Cost me fifty quid, that.", "Listen, now. Every time you investigate something, you end up in danger, Gwen.", "Don't you dare.", "I said don't you dare! Have you got that? Don't you bloody dare, Gwen! See, the thing is, right, if you think Miracle Day is like a Torchwood case, others are going to think the same, aren't they? They're gonna come looking for you with guns like they did the old days.", "We shouldn't even be in the city. There are cameras everywhere, man. And it's different now. You've got a daughter, and you can't go putting her into danger. That is why we live in the back of beyond, to keep her safe. We've got to go back.", "Oh, think about it! People aren't dying. He's gonna survive.", "Think about Anwen. Maybe our daughter's going to live forever.", "Possible, yeah. See, maybe you should let this happen for once.", "It's only a cut.", "Of course it's not a coincidence. Doesn't mean to say it's his fault.", "It's like we all got switched, isn't it? Nothing to do with Jack if the wires got crossed. Everything mortal becomes immortal, so everything immortal becomes mortal. See? I can be useful.", "Now you tell me. Tell me quickly, you bastard! You murdering bastard! Come on! Tell me before I get the boys round. Before I shout your name out loud in the street and fetch the bloody mob, tell me, what do you want?!", "So that's it? Dead end? Done? You finished with him? Can I have him now?", "Watch it, pal.", "It's both, you bunch of nuts. You can't see for looking, can you? Eh? Look. Right, Shanghai, Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires, Shanghai. Opposite sides of the world. Quite literally, opposite sides of the Earth, yeah? Yeah? So whatever's going on, there's got to be something connecting them.", "No, no, no. I've got, I've got better plans for you, bub.", "They can leave you here with me.", "Yeah.", "What?!"], "Bebe": ["Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!!", "Aaaaaaahhh!", "Yeah!

You guys are assholes!", "Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?", "What?", "What!?", "Shut up!"], "Peter": ["A black and a white talking as if it's normal!", "Everybody, shut up and let me think! Just let me think!", "[laughs] Oh, man. Classic American Dad!.", "We trying to ID the perp or your new girlfriend?", "Let me ask you something. My father... not my favorite. He is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son of a bitch on the planet... So he was a chemist. That much I already know. He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard doing research for a toothpaste company. I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night and my father was arrested, beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home. But here's the thing, Olivia. My gut tells me that your friend's life... the one hanging in the balance... not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste.", "When you say 'Fringe Science', you mean pseudo science?", "Whoa, excuse me for a sec, re-animation? Really? So you're telling me... what? My father was Dr. Frankenstein?", "You thought I'd be fatter? Excellent. First words, perfect.", "You shared your lab with the founder of Massive Dynamic?", "Ah, nothing really, just a tiny little company. That's perfect. One guy becomes one of the wealthiest men on the planet. The other guy becomes an institutionalized psychopath.", "[smiles] Excellent.", "[sarcastically] Right, cause after six hours, that's when they're really dead.", "(softly) I got you. I got you.", "Walter, I'm with a woman in her mid-twenties. She is going into cardiac arrest due to an overdoes of anesthesia. :[machine beeps] Her heart just stopped.", "Cocaine? No, I don't have any cocaine.", "Minor brain surgery.

That's what's so important you couldn't stop yourself from broadcasting?", "It occurs to me it might be easier to sleep in the tub.", "[from bathroom] Next time would you please drain the tub?!", "Walter is at the hotel. But don't worry, your agents are standing guard, not that it matters 'cause the man is unconscious. He was awake till five in the morning reciting the chemical compositions of his favorite beverages to me. That was right after he finished lecturing me on how I squandered on my above average intellect and my substantial education all while he was standing there naked. Because he 'prefers the breeze'.", "Who the hell are you? What is the cylinder?", "I'm a fairly open-minded guy, but there are things happening here that I can't even begin to explain and I'm not going anywhere until I can.", "Does this mean I don't need an escort to come into the Federal Building anymore?", "Will it get me out of speeding tickets?", "So let me tell you about my day, Walter. I was abducted, tortured, had two wires shoved up my nose that were connected to a machine I've never seen before and maybe the strangest part of the day is that somehow, without talking, I was able to answer a question that I didn't have the answer to.", "[coughs, clears throat] Visiting hours. Everybody put on their best straightjacket.", "That's his motto.", "So we're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity. I have you to thank for that, don't I?", "You were hoping for something more specific, maybe?", "That's only two questions.", "We don't think she ran away.", "Oh, Walter! Stop, wherever that's going it's just wrong.", "He has actually done that before. While I was sleeping. Really not something you want to wake up to.", "Spectacular? I'm sure he'd be just thrilled to hear your diagnosis.", "Is it the fruit cocktail thing again?", "Yeah, he's been doing that recently. He gets obsessed about certain foods. It's weird.", "To focus? Mr. Broyles, two-thirds of the time, my father's not even lucid. And in those rare and unpredictable moments of clarity, he rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed while he was incarcerated in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades. To say that he's not focused... is to say that he's a biped. Which is to say, you're absolutely right, he's not focused and also it's not going to change any time soon. I'm his son. I'm not a puppeteer. I don't have a remote control. There's no master switch I can flick and turn him into the man I wish had raised me. Or even somebody I don't have to babysit everyday. [pause] I guess I've had that on my mind for awhile.", "Oh, I just got off the phone with Olivia. She's headed back to the airport. Turns out Mr. Jones would only help us if he could talk to Mr. Smith. The same Mr. Smith that your people just killed.", "That's the first serious thing I've said all day.", "Hello?", "Thank you, Walter. I know who you are.", "I know that, but he's dead. He was shot. We're out of luck.", "Only you would ask that question seriously, yes, he still has a head.", "Well, it would also indicate that he's dead, but you didn't seem to have a problem with that.", "I've never had a conversation with a dead guy before. Forgive me if I don't know the rules.", "Think you might be able to jog your mind, Walter? Could be kinda helpful.", "Hey, Walter, don't you think it's a little early in the season for the yuletide cheer?", "So you thought it would be more useful to work on your Christmas tree decorations?", "The U.S. government had you working on mind control?", "What do you want me to do?", "Sorry, Walter, better luck next time.", "We've got good news. We think we understand how it was that Ben was abducted. Those red and green flashing lights? They put the father into a hypnogogic state.", "Walter, that wasn't me, that was you.", "[on his cell phone] Hello?", "Can you hold on for one second?", "It's really not that dire.", "No need to call the police.", "He's been like that all day. It's been awesome.", "You violated the laws of physics, Mr. Eastwick, and Mother Nature's a bitch.", "Walter, what are you doing?", "Dosing. As in LSD?", "I see. Hey, guess what just happened?", "Finding out that my father is giving drugs to bugs, somehow just became a typical moment in my life!", "Why not?", "And you think I'm the guy to break the law for you.", "No, look, you're right. I am the guy to break the law for you. What do you need?", "The man's insane, Olivia.", "[to Olivia] You're talking about a man who infects people with giant viruses. If you hadn't escaped, who knows what they would have done to you. Listen to me, you just told him that you killed his wife. He said that to you to try to get a reaction out of you. To get to you. Let it go. You got his confession. Go home.", "Ah, floppy disks are a little outdated. Why don't you focus on what you do best. All yours -- [hands Walter a beaker full of goo] -- liquid brains.", "Walter...", "I don't underestimate my father, by the way. I understand him. Sometimes more than I want to. Look, if I let him talk to that woman, she's just going to accuse him of killing her daughter, which is something he didn't do.", "Whose side are you on anyway?", "Congratulations. You just described the entire planet.", "I tried to expense a couple of Celtic tickets on the FBI--she caught me.", "Maybe he mutated into an opossum.", "You just had to ask, didn't you?", "God, I hope I never have to hear him say the word \"nipple\" again.", "What?", "(holding her close) You're okay. You're gonna be fine.", "Shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my M.O. And typically, if someone is going to kill you, it's a good idea to have an ally in the room.", "Being fearless doesn't mean you're being safe.", "Right here. Why don't you ask him what he's doing.", "...in Germany, right?", "Good for him. How?", "How come when nobody knows and it doesn't make sense, they come to us?", "You think we could get the answer to that question without me in the room?", "Once again... my father.", "Weird connections?", "Well, you're always a little weird.", "Walter, Olivia's here, she needs to talk to you. Walter!", "No, she can't come back later. It's the middle of the night. She needs to talk to you right now.", "I'm pretty sure I did.", "Really? You didn't think to mention that to the last guy?", "Hey, we're looking for Big Bird.", "Walter, these punctures are over four inches apart. And that would make this snake eight-feet long.", "Well, apparently you're looking for a lion-snake named Harriet.", "Right, a motley crew of lab animals got together and decided to exact their revenge on mankind.", "Are you okay? Did you take something?", "Yeah, a Geiger Counter.", "Great, well I'm glad we got that cleared up...", "New York it is.", "Walter, you're staying here [to Astrid] I'll make it up to you.", "Hey.", "I think we're cavemen in this story.", "Sexist cavemen at that.", "Come on, that's ridiculous!", "You know, until this year I'd never actually been to a mental hospital.", "Great...Why can't 'more angry' ever translate into less dangerous?", "Walter, that's enough.", "You really think it's a good idea to let him have free range in Walter's Believe It Or Not Emporium? ... And just for the record? One mad scientist is my limit.", "There's somethin' strange in your neighborhood...", "I'm sorry. The Khan?", "As in The Wrath of...?", "Let me guess. This war, it's against...", "The Federation. That would be the United Federation of Planets.", "Hmm. And you know this because?", "Which makes you Spock.", "Well, Mr. Spock, thank you for your time. We'll let you get back to the bridge now.", "You don't say?", "What else aren't you telling me, Walter?", "What's that? That once you enter a grocery store, you never leave again? Ever?", "Oh, yeah.", "Sure. Of course you can. Stay out of the medications, though. Please.", "Yeah... My father recently took a little trip down memory lane, and for no reason has become wildly obsessed with my childhood. He also likes to check and make sure that I'm still breathing when I'm asleep, which is a little creepy.", "Walter thinks that she was a shape-changing soldier from another universe. He thinks that might be where you went. Hmm. Do you think it's a bad sign that I can say that out loud and neither one of us thinks I'm crazy?", "No matter what happened to you and no matter where you went, Walter will figure it out. Olivia, I need to ask you something.", "Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy. You said that to me just after you woke up. Do you remember?", "Nuh-uh. Greek. My mother used to say that to me every night before I went to bed.", "It means be a better man than your father.", "Did you check the drawers?", "You're also no good at letting people help you.", "If we've stumbled upon a mutant? No. Fantastic's not the first word that pops into my mind.", "That was Olivia--Agent Jessup told her Hughes may have killed his wife and child 17 years ago.", "I need my own bedroom. I woke up this morning to him singing an aria from Pagliacci.", "Not when he's doing jumping jacks. And did I mention he was naked?", "Four words that should never show up in a sentence: \"classified experimental military project.\"", "Then what would I do? You're the one with a gun.", "Walter, I thought that we agreed this was a stupid idea.", "[to Olivia] He wants you to eat worms.", "I'm not hungry. I don't need any crepes.", "I'm okay, Walter.", "Well, that's great news. So, we'll add \"messy\" to the APB.", "So how many are there? Is it bad?", "Yeah.", "Get to know me a bit.", "Third patient: Stuart Gordon. Just like Mr. Crampton, fourteen years ago Dr. Paris refers him to a mental hospital with the psychiatric equivalent of a cough, which then develops to full-blown schizophrenia. Two days ago he miraculously recovers. Apparently Mr. Gordon thought he was the actor Sydney Greenstreet and walked around quoting Casablanca. That's funny.", "I think he looks a lot more like Peter Lorre. [awkward pause as Olivia doesn't laugh] That's a joke.", "Olivia, I know you think you're alone in this. Maybe that's because of what Bell told you, maybe that's just your personality, but this isn't just your fight.", "[referring to Walter] Did you see the look on this face when we were talking to Mr. Slater? What do you think that's like for him? Wishing that he could turn back the clock to before he went crazy. He's just sane enough to realize how much he lost.", "I should have visited him at St. Claire's.", "Last week, when Walter got lost, he did exactly what you'd expect Walter to do - he implanted a transponder chip into his neck so that, if he ever got lost, I could find him.", "What happened to subjects one through five?", "Like chicks with guns turned him on?", "[chuckles] Absolutely!", "You did something brave, too. The way you spoke up for those people. You didn't have to do that. I'm proud of you.", "Were you able to get a hold of Rachel?", "That's just like you. Even now you're protecting her. I thought that was the point of having people that cared about you in your life: to have someone to talk to when you're scared.", "Give me the gun Olivia.", "They're gonna kill us all anyway. The cure is out there. They're lying to us. And you locked me in here.", "You betrayed me!", "(steps on her arm) Hyuh!", "(after grabbing the pistol, he aims it at her) Stay down.", "I'm sorry.", "It's lucky for me that you were.", "Who?", "My guess would be no. [approaching Olivia and Manning]", "[smiling, appeasing Walter] You look lovely, Agent Dunham.", "[on the phone] You've got to be kidding me.", "I thought I told you people to take me off your contestant list.", "Do you have a supervisor? Anybody there I could complain to, because this has to stop.", "[hangs up] Walter, wake up. We just won an all expense paid trip to New York City.", "Maybe that's a good thing.", "Hey. Is this a part of Walter's test? Are you all right?", "Olivia, you... [pauses] I've never met anyone, who can do the things that you do.", "Don't be. [they lean in to kiss each other, but Olivia pulls away] What's wrong?", "Me? I'm going out for drinks.", "Olivia.", "No, just drinks. Apparently that's what normal people do. They go out for drinks. If you need to reach me, I'll leave the number of the restaurant right here, okay?", "I know. I heard it, too.", "Absolutely not. In fact, it would be my preference if you could be someplace else altogether.", "Chicago? [opens door] Hey, come on in. I know a great place that's just a couple blocks away. I thought we could walk.", "I'll go get my coat.", "There was another man on that bridge. When Newton\u2019s device started to work, I saw him there. Just, walking down the bridge. He had to have been from the other side. You said that the affects of Newton\u2019s vibrations would be devastating. And\u2026 They were, they destroyed that FBI agent, they just\u2026 they disintegrated him, like he wasn\u2019t even there. But they didn\u2019t kill the man from the other side. And they didn\u2019t kill me. I\u2019m not from here, am I? You didn\u2019t just open up a hole to the other side\u2026 You went through. And you brought me back. That\u2019s why I was able to survive Newton\u2019s device. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t remember my childhood.", "That\u2019s why my mother committed suicide. Isn\u2019t it? She knew, didn\u2019t she? And when I left, the guilt was too much for her to live with. The lie.", "I understand, Walter. I understand everything now.", "I am not your son! I\u2019d like to be alone now.", "Sometimes people with certain areas of expertise can offer them to the Bureau on a consulting basis. My area of expertise is...weird.", "No, I mean the strange, the inexplicable.", "No, I don't belong here. But I don't belong there, either", "[appearing to Olivia in a vision] You know why you didn't die today, right? Because you didn't know the protocol. If you had stopped for oxygen, you'd be dead right now, but you did something that he couldn't factor in. You kept running. You know why you did that. It's the same reason why you thought you saw Walter in the hospital. It's the same reason you think you see me now. You're not from this world, Olivia. You're not her.", "[smiles] Real is just a matter of perception. I am here, and I'm a part of you that you have to hold on to. You can't forget who you are, Olivia. You can't forget where you're from. You can't forget this. [kisses her softly]", "[speaking to Olivia in a vision] It makes sense now, doesn't it? Why they needed you to take that test voluntarily. Why they needed you to believe that you were their Olivia. They know you can cross over. You've done it before. That's how you ended up here in the first place.", "[speaking to Olivia in a vision] You know why you let him go, don't you? It's because you can understand what he's going through. Trapped in that amber, just like you're trapped over here. The only difference is, nobody's going to save you. Only you can save yourself. You listened to me about the case. I don't understand why you won't listen to me about this. Why do you refuse to believe who you are? Why do you want to deny the truth about yourself?", "But I know things.", "Exactly. Which means you know things, too. Things about the other side. Things you couldn't possibly know unless you'd been there. Unless you were from there.", "On the other side the Twin Towers have fallen. On the other side your sister Rachel is still alive. She lives in Chicago, her husband took a job there. They live at 1934 Sherman Way.", "On the other side your beautiful niece Ella is alive. She was born and it's her birthday today. She turned seven.", "Yes, there is.", "That's correct. I'm running diagnostics.", "I don't think that's entirely fair, do you?", "I'm sorry, Olivia.", "Olivia? Are you okay? What is it?", "Olivia...", "I'm sorry.", "I just want to try to explain the book.", "She asked me what my favorite book was. I understand that she probably wanted to just gather information about me, but I also know that I am not the easiest guy get to know. It was always easier for me to keep people in arms length. That's actually something that we both have in common. Book wasn't meant for her. It was meant for Olivia Dunham that I spent the last couple of my years with. Because I wanted you to read it. You're the person I wanted to share it with.", "Give me the keys and save the girl.", "What?", "Because it talks about not depending on other people for answers. You can only find the answers inside yourself. Which given our current situation, it's kinda of amusing, if you think about it.", "I know you want to help me, but I don't think you can this time. You can't protect me from everything.", "I suppose, it's just big enough to destroy a couple universes.", "Olivia, I wanted you to know that I noticed the differences. But I thought it was because of me, because of us. I thought that I was bringing out a different side in you. But it was never because I wanted to be with her more, because I don't.", "Yeah, this is pretty disgusting, even by our standards.", "What's the occasion Walter?", "He wants us to spend time together.", "No, just the two.", "I've seen what the two of us together looks like, and it's beautiful.", "And now? Who's the one stopping us now?", "Hey - Cupid!", "Well, if your plan was to make things even more awkward and painful between Olivia and I, yeah, it worked like a charm.", "That's where you draw the line? Ghosts?", "Olivia, you know that's not true.", "Your turn now.", "Yeah...", "Well, I wouldn't say that's exactly how it is, but yes, I know what you're talking about.", "I think I get the point.", "I had no idea(!). Okay, no more burrowing.", "What exactly am I looking for here Walter?", "Then why is she so committed to saving lives?", "I don't understand. If this is a projection of everything in Olivia's mind, then why is everyone turning against us? When she came to us in the lab, she asked for help.", "You're bald. I think he's an observer!", "[lying in bed, hugging Olivia close] What time is it?", "Oh God.", "[chuckles] Oh, yeah. It's Tuesday. He always cooks naked on Tuesdays.", "Nuh-uh, and it's not pretty either, but you get used to it.", "If it doesn't work, she's going to find out soon enough. Just tell her that...", "Ready?", "No. [holds out his hand for Olivia to take and smiles] Don't say I never took you anywhere.", "I want Walter. I want you to grant him a temporary furlough so he can help us on the case.", "Olivia Dunham, my wife, was everything to me.", "Walter; Stop [hold back his tears] Olivia is dead.", "The machine? I turned that on 15 years ago.", "If that's the case, just don't send the machine back. They will never discover it and I'll never destroy the other universe.", "Walter that doesn't make any sense.", "Imagine the repercussions.", "Walter, I know how strange this all is, how hard it must be for you, but I don't know what to do. Nobody remembers me here. Olivia looks at me like I'm a stranger; like she's afraid of me. I know what you're capable of. I need your help, Walter, to fix this.", "Walter, no.", "Walter, you don't understand.", "[laughs] I don't think so. It took three years until I finally got you. You're not getting rid of me that easy.", "I was checking up on Walter. He found the swing set, and you know how he feels about Newtonian mechanics. [he smiles as they watch Walter swing]", "The perfect day.", "What's the problem Olivia?", "I do.", "I love you.", "Pardon me?", "I don't know. She's -- she's driven. She's very, very stubborn. She doesn't like to lose. She sees the best in people, even when they don't see it in themselves. When she first found me I was in Baghdad trying to run this scam on two Iranian businessmen.", "[chuckles] That's what made me so good at it. Anyway, it was all supposed to be temporary. She told me I just had to babysit Walter while he was working on a case with the FBI, and when it was done I could leave back to my old life. Despite, of course, how gorgeous she is.", "She gave me something that I hadn't had since -- really since my mom died. She gave me a place to call home. A place I'd want to go home.", "[answers the door, smiling] Hey.", "Yeah, of course. How you feeling?", "How did you know that?", "That's not possible.", "I don't know what's going on, but something must be going on.", "Walter, whatever's happening to Olivia, I'm not doing it.", "As I'm sure you can understand, I'm confused.", "Olivia, I don't know what you want from me.", "[motions toward storage container] I think that's the one we're looking for.", "You mean with John Scott?", "How did you know it was Semtex?", "Because I didn't know it was Semtex until right now.", "Meaning Walter's theory can't possibly be right. I'm not projecting my memories onto you! You can't have memories that I've never had. I don't understand how this is happening.", "Olivia. I'm thinking about it. It's all I've been thinking about. I'm afraid. Afraid because I've made this mistake before. I betrayed the Olivia that I love. What I'm really afraid of is when I look in your eyes I know it's you. I know it's you.", "It's not Nina working for them that worries me. I've been wracking my brain, why would Nina be dosing Olivia with cortexiphan? Then it occurred to me: the only person who's ever done anything like that, at least in my timeline, is David Robert Jones. Maybe he's trying to do the same thing again.", "Activate Olivia.", "I don't know. We could never figure it out, but maybe it's for the same reasons now.", "[rushes to September's side] You! Talk to me! What do you know about David Robert Jones? What do you know about Olivia?", "I already know all that. Walter told me, but what were you doing there?", "What child?", "My what?", "Henry. [smiles] I have a son.", "What's happening?", "I'm not doing anything until you tell me where to find Olivia.", "First responders are on the way. You're going to be fine.", "Maybe, or maybe it was me. Just by being close to you, like Walter said.", "Neither am I. At the gas station, just before you got taken, you were ready to come home with me and I was ready to think that as okay, but it wasn't. It was a mistake. One that I promised myself that I'd never let happen again.", "I saw her! I saw my Olivia. The one that I'm supposed to be with. The only one that I'm supposed to be with.", "No. No. You have her memories. You have my memories of her or your projection, but when I looked into your eyes, what I saw was what I wanted to see. I know she's out there. My Olivia in my timeline, waiting for me, and I let myself forget that. So I'm sorry, Olivia, but I'm sure Walter can fix you up somehow and give you back your life, but right now it's better if I stay away.", "Home. I have to go home.", "I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York: Olivia.", "And why is that, Walter?", "Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?", "Na eisai enas kalyteros andras apo ton patera sou.", "Yes. It means \"be a better man than your father.\" It's something I was told a long time ago, but it is very strange to hear you say it.", "I have tried everything that I can think of, everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked. Nobody here can help me, but you can. I know you can. Please help me get back home.", "I don't understand. I was erased.", "And Olivia?", "You want to talk about it or should we just pretend that we already did? Olivia.", "You're a good guy.", "I hope so. The lady here is looking for a book called Lake of the Long Sun by Gene Wolfe, do you know him?", "Is that when the world ends or when the aliens arrive? [smiles as he watches Olivia smile]", "No, actually the celestial ship turns into the serpent god.", "That's because I was out.", "Medford?", "Holliston.", "Woburn.", "All right. How about Lexington?

Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there's some things you should know, and one of them is, there's absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports. We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are allies. Now, none of this is the fault of a 20 year old college student. But you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the worst. generation. ever. So when you ask, \"what makes us the greatest country in the world?\" I dunno know what the fuck you're talking about. Yosemite? [Pause] We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money where our mouths were. And we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn't belittle it, it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in our last election. And we didn't... we didn't scare so easy. We were able to be all these things, and to do all these things, because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.

Then, you sent an e-mail, explaining in some detail, what happened and then you copied 47 reporters on it.", "You know how sometimes something happens in an instant that's so astonishing you just... shut down?", "THAT DOESN'T! FUCKING! HAPPEN! TO ME!", "[Sarcastically] REALLY?!", "[Will angrily charges at Martin and is blocked by Mackenzie and Maggie] WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!", "Why were you sending it at all?", "[Points angrily to his office] GET IN THERE!", "Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy. This is News Night, and that was a clip of Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism chief to President George W. Bush, testifying before Congress on March 24, 2004. Americans liked that moment. I liked that moment. Adults should hold themselves accountable for failure. And so tonight I'm beginning this newscast by joining Mr. Clarke in apologizing to the American people for our failure. The failure of this program during the time I've been in charge of it to successfully inform and educate the American electorate. Let me be clear that I don't apologize on behalf of all broadcast journalists, nor do all broadcast journalists owe an apology. I speak for myself. I was an accomplice to a slow and repeated and unacknowledged and unamended train wreck of failures that have brought us to now. I'm a leader in an industry that miscalled election results, hyped up terror scares, ginned up controversy, and failed to report on tectonic shifts in our country. From the collapse of the financial system to the truths about how strong we are to the dangers we actually face. I'm a leader in an industry that misdirected your attention with the dexterity of Harry Houdini while sending hundreds of thousands of our bravest young men and women off to war without due diligence. The reason we failed isn't a mystery. We took a dive for the ratings. In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress. Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service. That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news. Congress, unable to anticipate the enormous capacity television would have to deliver consumers to advertisers, failed to include in its deal the one requirement that would have changed our national discourse immeasurably for the better. Congress forgot to add that under no circumstances could there be paid advertising during informational broadcasting. They forgot to say that taxpayers will give you the airwaves for free and for 23 hours a day you should make a profit, but for one hour a night you work for us. And now those network newscasts, anchored through history by honest-to-God newsmen with names like Murrow and Reasoner and Huntley and Brinkley and Buckley and Cronkite and Rather and Russert-- Now they have to compete with the likes of me. A cable anchor who's in the exact same business as the producers of Jersey Shore. And that business was good to us, but News Night is quitting that business right now. It might come as a surprise to you that some of history's greatest American journalists are working right now, exceptional minds with years of experience and an unshakeable devotion to reporting the news. But these voices are a small minority now and they don't stand a chance against the circus when the circus comes to town. They're overmatched. I'm quitting the circus and switching teams. I'm going with the guys who are getting creamed. I'm moved that they still think they can win and I hope they can teach me a thing or two. From this moment on, we'll be deciding what goes on our air and how it's presented to you based on the simple truth that nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed electorate. We'll endeavor to put information in a broader context because we know that very little news is born at the moment it comes across our wire. We'll be the champion of facts and the mortal enemy of innuendo, speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense. We're not waiters in a restaurant serving you the stories you asked for just the way you like them prepared. Nor are we computers dispensing only the facts because news is only useful in the context of humanity. I'll make no effort to subdue my personal opinions. I will make every effort to expose you to informed opinions that are different from my own. You may ask who are we to make these decisions. We are Mackenzie McHale and myself. Miss McHale is our executive producer. She marshals the resources of over 100 reporters, producers, analysts, technicians, and her credentials are readily available. I'm News Night's managing editor and make the final decision on everything seen and heard on this program. Who are we to make these decisions? We're the media elite.

Now if you'll excuse me, mea going upstairs for a culpa hours.", "Morning.", "Not too bad, really.", "Yeah, if I hadn't been plastered, it might have killed me.", "It is a selling point. Right up there with making ugly people doable.", "Yeah, but they're all gay.", "[About Alan's date with Danielle] Okay, on this date don't talk about your stupid hobbies or your depressing problems.", "Her stupid hobbies! Her depressing problems! Okay. I'm gonna make up some reason I have can't go and then you can go on a date.", "Oh darn...", "I just remembered I have a lot of work to do at home.", "No, no, no. You guys should go ahead. I'm sure you'll have fun.", "She just moved next door. She's gorgeous, divorced, and loaded!", "Why does something have to be wrong with her?", "There is nothing wrong with Danielle. Berta, is she or is she not gorgeous?", "Yeah, you're right. I don't even like eating dinner next to you.", "Orgies, wine, and bulimia. Go ahead, ask me about the Greeks.", "What's to explain? You have a Malibu beach house and you're the... \"Chiropractor to the Stars\".", "OK, I can understand that. You're probably not gonna get a lot of responses to \"bushy-nosed cheapskate, enjoys long walks to a free meal.\"", "Leanne, tell me something. Is it just me, or is the crowd in here getting younger?", "I'm not old. Forty's the new thirty, right?", "Rose! [to Alan]: How is she gonna brush your job?", "I don't have time for this, Alan! [he walks back inside and heads toward the front door]", "Yeah, I just can't find my damn stalker. [leaves]", "What are you staring at?", "Listen, why don't you check your list for... Jackson.

As the eldest son it's my obligation to pound in the stake.", "OK, you can cut off her head and hold it up for the villagers.", "He's been watching MTV Cribs. The kid's a sponge.", "I do.", "Yep. Do you carry Chanel No. 666?", "Who wants two gay guys and a Chinese kid?", "Hey Jake, you're a pasty, white kid, start acting like one!", "Shhh, Shampoo's about to play his cello.", "Now you know why Alan wears it.", "Hey, what's your hurry? If she [Kandi] becomes a big TV star while you're still married, she'll have to pay you alimony!", "All right, look, it doesn't help to whine about it. If you wanna get lost in the woods with Jerky Gerkenheimer, go do it.", "Actually, it's more of a limerick. There once was a moron named Al, who wanted to camp with his pal... Any chance you can go camping in Nantucket?", "Do you know how to fish, or camp, or, hunt?", "Oh that sounds good. You and knucklehead out in the woods, taking turns shooting each other in the ass.", "What's the big deal? It's just an alimony check.", "Oh, right! Judith is getting married this weekend!", "You can finally kick in a few bucks around here?", "Not in my house.", "That's good, because I'd hate to have to stand on line.", "I know what you mean. I did the same to my brother.", "Well, actually it was a thousand dollar hooker.", "Thank you.", "Beg pardon?", "No, it's not like that at all, and why do you even care?", "Oh, that's ridiculous!", "Well yeah-", "That part's not my fault!", "Hold on, that chick was nuts!", "To be fair, you didn't have that much to begin with!", "That is not how it happened!", "How?! Explain how!", "This relationship isn't based on sex!", "Kind of a letdown after the ceremony.

I got a rash in my, you know, private area.", "Right, for people who've been walking over eighty-five years.", "Ah, he's smarter than that.", "What about me?", "Like what?", "Hold on. Hold on a sec. I am not afraid to open my eyes under water. I'm just sensitive to chlorine. And for the record, it's just when birds get indoors. In the sky, I got no problem.", "And what sane person is not afraid of spiders?", "Yeah, well, we have a saying in my country, too: \"Help me, my balls are on fire!\"", "I tried it once, but I prefer a real woman.", "You're really enjoying this, aren't you? You just love seeing me unhappy.", "That was different.", "It was you.", "She [Evelyn] can be a cranky drunk.", "Where the hell should I go?", "Are you crazy? I'm not going out the window.", "I'm going out the window.", "Hey, if you two [birds] don't have any other plans, why don't you fly over to the Hollywood Bowl and take a crap on my brother?", "A blind date?

I haven't gone out with a forty-year-old woman since high school!", "Oh, I hardly think so.", "Aw, man, you didn't tell me that!", "It makes a big difference! The smarter the girl, the harder it is to blow smoke up her ass!", "All right, forget it, I don't need you. I'll call her [Linda] myself. [leaves]", "I don't know. Someplace where the bottles are full and the women are empty.", "You're welcome. [they kiss]", "Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure you don't want me to tuck you in?", "Oh, come on, everybody needs a good tucking once in a while.", "I guess I'll have to.", "Where?", "You want to straighten him out, or should I?", "OK, the reason guys say \"Hot girl at\", like, \"twelve o'clock\" or \"three o'clock\" is to specify a location using the clock face as kind of a map.", "First of all, you're not gonna meet any women if you're wearing a digital watch.", "What?", "If you're doing the laundry, all I can say is you're doing it wrong.", "Yeah, so?", "Fine, what do you need?", "Oh, for God's sake. Who is it?", "We didn't order anything.", "Can you slip it under the door?", "Everyone's using old rock songs now.

Do you have any idea how beautiful you look in that light?", "Yeah, well, I'm not talking to you either, except for right now, this is me talking to you, but, no longer.

I am sorry about last night.", "Ooh, yeah! I mean, unless I did something else.", "Look, I understand why you're mad, but it really wasn't my fault.

But now I'm thinking it was a little something she had left over from Woodstock.", "Hard to punish him for telling the truth.", "Hey, leave Jake out of this.", "What I'm saying is, you got nothing to complain about.

And the receptionist was your fault.", "If you'd paid her a decent salary, she wouldn't have had to hook.", "How could you take the fall for me?", "Nice, huh?", "You should see her naked.", "Well, I could show you pictures, but you may not wanna see that much of me.", "You really wanna know?", "Well, see Alan, it's like this. I got a knack.", "I didn't think so, but you asked.", "Hey, everybody's good at something. You, for instance... [stares at Alan] have no shame.", "Alan, I just took a Tour de France, and the only thing I was wearing was a smile and a condom.", "I thought you said he got dumped!", "Oh, good idea.

[Alan stares at him] Sorry, I should have eased into that.", "When are they gonna invent a phone with a breathalyzer lock?", "Hey.", "How'd it go with Gabrielle?", "Yeah, I do. It's kinda like necrophilia, isn't it?", "Really?", "Nope.", "Yep. But I didn't want to hurt her feelings. Thanks for helping me out with that.", "Not quite.", "She looks great, doesn't she? Come on, baby.", "Now we're even. (leaves with Charity; Alan gets enraged to the point where he says...)", "OK, OK, listen to me. Boxing is a science. Boxers don't just wail on each other. They strategize, feel each other out, wait for an opening.", "Oh, does that hurt?", "Good. (Alan appears)", "Good. Where have you been?", "You promised he'd grow on me.", "So, how was you and Donna?", "Jungle humping?", "You poor bastard.", "You poor, poor bastard.", "If only.", "I'm a monogamous, settle-down kind of guy who hangs on to a relationship until I'm looking at divorce papers or the pointy end of a steak knife.", "You're just afraid if you let go of one of these broads, you're never going to get laid again.", "I once handed a date my Visa so she could pump gas for me, and in my next statement, there were charges for a boob job and a PlayStation 3.

You're gonna break up with her and then drive her home? You'll need the Jaws of Life to get her out of your car.", "It's common sense.

Daytime's better. Dancers are a little worse for wear but they try harder.", "Hello? Anybody here? Anybody gonna take care of good old Charlie? OK, then.

I call it the \"Drunken Hulk\".", "It's called \"doughnuts\".", "How do you feel about bushes, Herb?", "I like 'em trimmed.", "Hey, I told you she would go out with you.", "Huh. So you're saying Farmer Herb's tilling soil you couldn't even get your hoe into.", "Yeah, you know with an \"e\"? \"Hoe\"?", "Could be. He's about six-four, got big hands... if everything else is proportional, I'm guessing he could ring doorbells with that thing.", "I rarely do.", "How much you looking to spend?", "Yeah, but unfortunately, they don't stock hookers at the 99-cent store.", "Here.

Then something good came of this.", "Yep. Settle down, have a couple of kids, and ship the penis up to Cooperstown.", "It is my bat.", "You don't ever figure this stuff out, Alan. You just take little baby steps on a lifelong path to becoming a better man.", "It's your fifth wedding, Mom. What do you need help with, besides remembering the groom's name?", "What are you doing?", "Just remember to put the seat back down.", "I don't know.

One: If at all possible, ladies first. Two: It's easier to be forgiven than ask permission. And third and most important: the ten seconds it takes to put on a condom beats the hell out of the ten years you have to pretend to like soccer.", "Stupid tiny disclaimer on the side of the box.

How do you like your eggs?", "Scrambled it is.", "So where's your friend?", "Only you can gay up banging two women.", "You know, your body's sending you a message.", "Your body is also telling you that alcohol is poison.", "Because there are things inside of me I need to kill.", "Right.", "I'm sure you have.", "You know what the problem is? The women, the drinking... you guys look at me and you think it's easy.

You're thinking about the old Charlie - The old hump'em and dump'em one track mind Charlie.", "I'm serious. I honestly want to start building a relationship.", "Yeah. Get to know someone.

Idiots do.", "Yeah.", "Uh-huh.", "Gone the way of the dodo bird, my friend.", "I don't have an answer for you, Herb.", "Yep. They're shaped like Disney characters.", "Alan, you had a perfect night of revenge sex. That's the fourth-best kind of sex you can have!", "What?", "She'd better be ready to call an ambulance.", "Different than the one who threw you out of your house with your nuts in a to-go bag?", "I'm an artist, Alan. I paint with words.", "Can you believe she wants me to schlep all the way over to her place just so we can spend the night together?", "And forty-five minutes to get back.

A movie it is. What's out that's good?", "Hey, Jake...", "Yeah, terrific. Listen, my date's in the ladies' room, and I need you to do something for me.", "Boy you really blew it this time.", "Damn right your bad.

[A caged bird shrieks behind him] Genetic alteration. These fascinating hybrids, or \"hy-birds\" as we call them, will be released and monitored to see how they adapt to the unique properties of the Island-- successful advanced studies in larger mammals. Ursus maritimus, or polar bears, possess a keen sense of memory and adaptability. These traits make them ideal candidates for electromagnetic studies that will be conducted at a secondary site where their comfort in cold temp-- It's important when dealing with the bears that you do not show affection or become attached in any way. Also, do not underestimate their intelligence and cunning. These rules must always be followed. I repeat, the bears are not your friends. Rewarding the bear with a fish biscuit, once it has successfully performed a complex puzzle. After the training is completed, you will tranquilize the bear. Affix this tracking device around the subject's neck. At which point it will be transported to the Orchid station for the next phase of research. Remember, be sure to confirm that the female bears have not been impregnated before transport, as the electromagnetic levels at the Orchid have an extremely harmful effect on early term gestation. As you've already learned, we do animal research here at Hydra. Unfortunately, one must consider the most dangerous animal of all, humans. And so, there is another more secluded test site, where we are conducting significantly more sensitive work. The Island's indigenous population, some of you may have heard them referred to as \"Hostiles\", are acquired on the main Island, sedated and brought here, to Room 23. Because the subjects are unwilling participants, security personnel should always be present during these sessions. Under no circumstances are you to engage subjects in conversation. The purpose of these interrogations is to better understand the Hostiles' way of life, their origins, and particularly their worship of an Island deity they refer to as \"Jacob\". After the research team has concluded their tests, inject this into the back of the subject's neck. Then place these goggles over his or her eyes. Hitting this switch will commence the visualization while the drugs take effect.

Any memory of his or her interrogation will be effectively wiped clean.

That place is lame.", "Where?", "Not Okay. Okay is lame.", "Not Okay!", "Hey, where are our chicken wings?", "Barney, what are you doing here?", "Really, because it looks like my insane friend rented a costume and broke into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish was the first time.", "Barney, there's condoms in the drawer, just take it and get out-", "Whoo, lighting change!", "I can't decide. They're both awesome.", "Yes, yes, great idea. Let the fates decide, huh? [speaks while alternating fists] I will pick left. [Lily slaps him]", "Oh, guess who I ran into [at the Architect's Ball]. A girl from my past. Any guesses?", "You make it sound like I dated a series of Stieg Larsson novels.", "Forget it? I will never forget it! Okay? I will never stop regretting it, because what we had meant that much to me! I just\u2026I wish it had meant something to you, too.", "Did you?", "I hate that guy.", "Probably a good idea.

Well, today, I took my name off it. The apartment...is now yours and I think I've found what to do with Robin's old room. [They walk in to Robin's old room and find that it is painted blue and has been turned in to a baby room] See for me, this place had begun to feel a little haunted. At first I thought it was haunted by Robin, but I now think it was haunted by me. Well, no ghost is at peace until it finally moves on. I need a change, and I think you do too.

Things aren't so bad.", "Come on, if there's one thing I can count on not changing, it's you walking with some random girl under your arm.", "Why are you still here?", "I guess because I'm in love with you. Why else would I be seeing your face everywhere I look?", "Of course I feel bad. I told you I love you, which is apparently the worst thing you can say to someone.", "[pause] I miss you.", "I know where we should go.", "Your wedding. I'm taking you back.", "I do want this. I've thought about you so many times, what might have been...but I got left at the altar and it nearly killed me. You're someone's fiancee, and I have to respect that.

They have loyalty and heart, I bet you he rewards that.", "I poured all my blood, sweat and tears into that building. To be fair, a lot of it happened the day I accidentally fell down that elevator shaft. The point is, it's just really hard to let go, especially since that building's my biggest accomplishment.

In exactly 45 days from now, you and I are gonna meet and are gonna fall in love, and we're gonna get married and we're gonna have two kids. We're gonna love them and each other so much. All that is 45 days away, but I'm here now I guess because ... I want this extra 45 days with you. I want each one of them - and if I can't have them, I'll take the 45 seconds before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in the face, because ... I love you. I'm always gonna love you to the end of my days, and beyond. You'll see.", "I'm just saying if I was getting married in three weeks -", "You're right, not my place. Why don't I get the next round.", "No, it's important that you keep it.", "This is the first thing we bought when we moved here after college. It was the only piece of furniture we had for a week, and now you two are moving to Italy. What if our friendship doesn't pass the \"Have you used it in a year?\" test?

You're not supposed to believe any of that.", "It's not a sign, you're doing the right thing marrying Barney. The universe isn't sending you some message!

Do you know how many signs I've gotten, how I should and shouldn't be with someone? Where has it gotten me? Maybe there aren't any signs. Maybe a locket's just a locket; a chair's just a chair. Maybe we don't have to give meaning to every little thing. Maybe we don't need the universe to tell us what we really want. Maybe we already know that. Deep down.

One year ago today, almost to the minute, I was sitting at this very table, right in that seat.

They drew something on the street outside his house. The Scythe.", "Should he?", "If you want this guy to produce again, why not just tell him? You're the only thing that stands between him and an axe to the head.", "Hmm, foreseeable. Couple of years at least, barring acts of God or men with axes.", "Have a seat, Walter. I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.", "I'm not gonna do it.", "Because it's moronic.", "That's not the moronic part.", "The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.", "My boss. Your boss. This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I'm here, understand? But our employer would find out like always, and if Pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem. Walt, you got a good thing going here. We all do. You want to risk it all on one junkie? Now I realize you two have a history, but this kid's been on the bubble a while now. It's a long time coming.", "[Chuckles] Um... I used to be a beat cop, long time ago. And I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time, hundreds probably over the years. But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit, that I will never forget: Gordy. He looked like Bo Svenson. You remember him? Walking Tall? You don't remember?", "Anyway. Big boy; 270, 280. But his wife, or whatever she was, his lady, was real small. Like a bird, wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say, \"C'mon, tonight's the night we press charges.\" And this wasn't one of those 'deep down he really loves me' setups, we got a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn't gonna cross him no way, no how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next morning out he goes, back home. But one night, my partner's out sick and it's just me. And the call comes in and it's the usual crap. Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we're driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my backseat humming 'Danny Boy'. And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere. And I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth and I told him, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone, screaming \u2013 much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him to be quiet, that I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. And of course he got quiet. Goes still, and real quiet, like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while: me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. After a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth and I say; \"So help me if you ever touch her again I will such and such and such and such and blah blah blah blah blah\".", "Hmph. Of course. Just trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later he killed her. Of course. Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender. We got there, there was so much blood you could taste the metal. The moral of the story is, I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way. I'll never make that mistake again. [stands up] No more half measures, Walter.", "Walter, you see us?", "I'd like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.", "I assure you I could kill you from way over here if it makes you feel any better.", "I don't know, Walt. It's what I do after all.", "Now when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we? And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.", "Is that right?", "I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in.", "Saul, don't make me beat you until your legs don't work. Now tell me where to find him. You know it's the right thing.", "Yeah, unfortunately I do, Walter. Downstairs.", "No.", "No.", "No. Walter...", "SHUT UP! Shut up. I can't do it. I'm sorry.", "Where is he? Right now you give me an address.", "Just what the hell was that exactly?", "Yeah? [cocks gun] Why?", "I've never used this stuff. Are you sure it will do the job?", "[without turning around to look at Walter] You might want to learn how to tail better if you plan on making a habit of it.", "Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do.", "[sarcastically] There's a load off my mind.", "I get it. Fine. Drink up, Walter.", "[rolls eyes and sighs]", "So...what's with the piece? Right hip, inside your waist band. I noticed it the other day at the lab. Now you wear it if it makes you feel better, but if push comes to shove, it's not gonna help.", "Drink your drink.", "You won, Walter. You got the job. Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer.", "You done?", "[putting on his jacket and stepping over Walter] Thanks for the drink.", "[to Jesse] You're on thin ice, you little shithead. You know that?", "You are not the guy. You're not capable of being the guy. I had a guy but now I don't. You are not the guy.", "I don't know! It's not my call! I just do what I'm told and now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here, shut up, and stay in the car until we finish our pickups! You got it?", "If I had to put it in a word, I'd guess loyalty.", "Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.", "I wouldn't.", "Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.", "Shut your mouth. You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. I don't want you talking to me or Jesse. Just get the barrel. And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.", "I promise you this: either we're all going home or none of us are. Now settle down.", "Shut up!", "What exactly are you celebrating? You left the truck behind!", "\"So what?\" So what if they find prints? What if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?", "Well, you got all the answers. So you tell me, answer man: did all that even work just now?", "I'm supposed to take that on faith, yeah? Why? How do we know?", "Thanks, but no thanks.", "I am. You...are trouble. [leans forward] I'm sorry the kid doesn't see it, but I sure as hell do. You are a time bomb, tick-tick-ticking. And I have no intention of being around for the boom.", "Just because you shot Jesse James, don\u2019t make you Jesse James.", "Alright, Lydia. My friends here don't know you like I do, so they are very kindly giving you one last chance. [pulls out a notepad] There's your script. Study it. In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader on your line here. You're gonna pass along this information, then we'll see what we see. Now here are the rules: if you yell for help, try to give the man some kind of coded message or otherwise tip him off, I am gonna pull out my pistol and shoot you in the head. Same goes for panicking, breaking down into tears \u2013 remember how you like to do that \u2013 if it happens this time, I am going to pull my pistol out and I am going to shoot you in the head.

It's a pistol, not a gun. I'm expecting precision here. [turns to Jesse] We up and running?", "OK, Lydia, if you ever needed to give the performance of a lifetime, it's now. [sets the cell phone down] You're up.", "Might as well get comfortable. This deal is going down tomorrow. It's happening and there's nothing you can do to stop it. Got it?", "[interrupting] To insure that, you and I are going to spend the rest of the night together in this office, like it's my birthday.", "When the deal is done, you'll get your money. I guarantee that.", "You know, I have never seen anybody work so hard not to get five million dollars.", "No. Walter, the last thing I need to do is listen to you. Now sit down.", "[sees that the methylamine is gone] Where is he?", "[shoving Jesse] Get out of my way. [draws a gun on Walter] You sit down.", "[holding the gun at Walter's temple] I am going to count to three.", "1...2...", "[pause] Is that true, Walter?", "All of this \u2013 falling apart like this \u2013 is on you!", "We had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch!

Not because I have unsubstantiated deductions, which I have. Not because I take the occasional cash payment from a client and forget to report it, which I do.

And if pigs start flying out of my rear end, we'll have free bacon for the rest of our lives!", "My life is just one big joke to you, isn't it?", "[About Jake growing up] Pretty soon there'll be no more playing catch or riding bikes. Do you realize I've never even taken him fishing, or camping, or hunting?", "No, I thought we would learn together.", "It's dark out.", "Not an alimony check. This is my final alimony check. Isn't it beautiful?", "Exactly. And you know what that means?", "Good one. No. It means Alan gets new underwear.", "You know what? This really isn't that funny. [throws the oversized alimony check aside]", "Herb, is this a bad time?", "Excuse me?", "You know, Charlie, there's a special section in Hell reserved for people like you.", "OK, um, let me just start, uh, by saying I applaud the, uh, the gusto with which you approach life.", "Um, that being said, uh, are you, um, out of your FREAKIN' MIND?!", "You just could not control yourself; 'A female is in the house, she must be mounted!'", "Why?! You ask me why?! I will tell you why: because every time you rut with any woman even remotely connected to my life, I end up suffering!", "Ridiculous, you say? Alright, alright let's look at the record. You slept with Judith's sister...", "At my wedding reception! You had more sex on my wedding day that I did!", "Ok, let's jump ahead. When Judith was divorcing me, who seduced and then abandoned my lawyer, causing her to take revenge on me?!", "I lost everything!", "And now that Judith is finally getting remarried, and I can see the light at the end of the alimony tunnel, you decide \"Hey, why don't I start humping her new sister-in-law?\"!", "I don't care how it happened! I only care how it's gonna end, and it's gonna end badly for me!", "I don't know yet! That's always part of the fun; trying to guess how your penis is going to bite me in the ass!", "Because you're going to your mother's wedding, not hosting a game show on Telemundo.", "OK, listen, we-- we haven't really, uh, talked about what all this means.", "All the big changes that are happening.", "How was the reception?", "Damn camera phones.", "You think I joined a support group to pick up women?", "Your mom will be here any minute! I-- I thought I told you to get ready!", "Did you do your homework?", "Are you sure?", "No.", "No. Uh, well, oh, maybe George Clooney.", "What a day. Just sitting and sitting and sitting.", "It was like jury duty, without the fun of sending someone to jail.", "Well, I don't want him to think like that!", "For the last time, I misdialed!", "Why don't you come in here?", "You told her you had a bug, so she assumed it was bronchial. If you'd been more specific like I suggested, you could have precluded this. Nobody just drops by when they think you have diarrhea.", "Charlie, you want to fire this guy [Fernando] just because he's younger and better looking than you.", "Yeah! I wouldn't fire the handyman before he finishes!", "Yeah, but what about us?", "Why not? He seems like a great guy.", "How do they feel?", "They're not old people shoes. They're walking shoes.", "I hope he [Jake] didn't wander under the bleachers during lunch hour.", "Smart? Charlie, he only got out of sixth grade 'cause he couldn't fit in the desks anymore.", "And-And what about you?", "You're afraid of everything.", "Well, let's see. Germs, change, commitment, opening your eyes under water, angry husbands, angry ex-girlfriends, large birds, spiders, and mom.", "Fine, fine. Live in denial. I'm gonna try and straighten my kid out.", "Remember, Jake, courage is not the absence of fear, it's taking action despite fear.", "Well, I-- I'd love to help you out, Mom, but, uh, I have a date tonight.", "No, no, I really have a date. And-- and the doll was a gag gift from one of my patients.", "Now, I have been to a lot of these things with Mom, and I know you think it's gonna be bad, but believe me, it's gonna be worse than you can even imagine.", "Yeah. I mean, did you feel sorry for me when I had to wear that cowboy outfit to her celebrity AIDS hoedown?", "How?", "Yeah, well, now it's you. Yippie-ki-yay, mother-accompanier.", "Cranky? I got bitch-slapped with my own ten-gallon hat.", "Sharon, I have been rejected by... thirty-two different women in my life. And you know what? It's never been me.", "Actually, no.", "No, no, that's even worse! You know what they say about nice guys?", "No, they finish in the shower.", "Hey, Berta? You're a woman.", "I was just wondering, uh, what does it mean when someone starts crying uncontrollably after sex?", "He doesn't?", "Can't we ask him?", "OK, but does he have to say it in the third person?", "I can't believe it. You're nervous about a date.", "Well, Charlie, that's the great thing about seeing someone your own age. There's always something to talk about because what you've been through, she's been through.", "All right, point taken. But she's a fascinating woman. She's a municipal court judge, she teaches law at UCLA...", "Does that make a difference?", "Oh, come on, Charlie, so you struck out with a woman. It happens. Believe me, it happens! And when it does, the best thing to do is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and curse God for making you the way you are.", "That would be nine o'clock.", "Go ahead, take a swing.", "No, more like he's trying to get into something.", "You understood that?", "Charlie?", "I need your help.", "No, no, the, uh, the lady I've been seeing, you know, uh, Linda's friend, Donna? Uh, she wants to, how shall we say, take it up a notch.", "I'm out of notches.", "A younger man's penis.", "His middle name isn't Roscoe--", "Continue.", "His middle name is Francis.", "You're-- you're living in a dream world! Money doesn't just fall from the sky.", "Jake, buddy, you're the memento of our time together.", "She did better than earrings. She got my family jewels.", "[to Jake] Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?", "I'm not talking to you.", "Would you please just... go to sleep?", "Charlie, wake up. You need to see this.", "No.", "You're going back to your room. And I'm going back to the sweet land of vindication.", "Look, don't worry, you'll grow into it.", "Yeah, well, quit going through puberty and we'll talk about it.", "Hey, hey, watch your mouth!", "So I can't even have one stupid thing in this house?", "Hey, those towels are very pretty! They brighten up the whole room!", "They do not!", "No, you said you didn't want it on the front table for keys, so I put it on the coffee table for candy.", "Before we got here, this was just a big empty space where you just sat around, got drunk, and had casual sex with women you don't even care about.", "When did you become the king of kids' songs?", "What? They couldn't make it smell like bourbon?", "What?", "Charlie, you have to get out there.", "They love him! How can they love him?", "Doesn't it bother you that he's loaded?", "Oh, yeah! I spent twelve years watching my wife fake migraines and orgasms.", "What kind of man would hit on his future step-sister?", "That's... that's great, but how come you have no problem looking me in the eye after sleeping with my wife's sister, my son's teacher, my divorce lawyer, and my old receptionist?", "How?", "I don't know, but it always seem works out that when you get laid, I get screwed!", "A what?", "Oh, yes. Yes, yes, I'm very passionate about, uh... \"bee-seek-ling\". I, I-- I even have a stationary \"see-kel\".", "I-- I also jog, and, uh, ab crunch, and of course, \"Les... Buns of Steel\".", "Nice? She's magnificent!", "Can I?", "Just out of curiosity, where do you find women like that? And-- and more importantly, how do you get them to go to bed with you?", "Yeah, what-- what's your secret?", "[moment of silence] That's not a secret.", "So that's it, you got a knack?", "Excuse me, this is what they wear in the Tour de France.", "So, uh, how was school this week?", "Anything noteworthy happen?", "I was easing into it.", "Jake, sooner or later every guy gets dumped.", "I don't care. I got her [his high school girlfriend] number off the Internet and I'm calling her.", "I did.", "'Cause he never got married. [slams door in Judith's face] Oh, that's gonna come back to bite me in the ass. [he hears a knock on the door] And here it comes, jaws-a-snappin'. All right, I'm sorry! [he opens the door, but Gabrielle is there instead]", "I just find it's easier that way.", "Hey.", "I think you know how it went.", "I didn't go through with it.", "Guess we're different that way. (pause) So... I didn't really steal her from you, did I?", "You were trying to get rid of her the whole time, weren't you?", "Well, at least now we're even, right?", "What do you mean?", "Charity? Charity Kirschenbaum?", "Yeah. 20 years.", "But, but, but...", "[yelling from distance] I... HATE... YOOOOOOOOUUUU!", "I do aim to please.", "The key is efficient foreplay.

I'll tell you later.", "I lied.", "It was okay. It may not have been crazy-hot monkey sex like when we first started dating, but it was very much in the general category of, uh, jungle humping.", "Yes. Maybe not, you know, tree swinging, but certainly canoodling on some low-hanging branches.", "Don't you dare feel sorry for me! This is what an adult relationship looks like, Charlie. People get comfortable with each other and they develop a routine. And if it's not always fireworks and explosions, well, that's a reasonable trade for a warm, collegial partnership.", "This conversation is over. (storms off)", "(reappears) Okay, it's boring! It's suffocating! It's a deathwatch! But what choice do I have, Charlie? Pretend I'm you? I'm not you.", "Oh, that's a load of crap.", "Didn't I just say that?!", "Yes, yes, I'm gonna go to her house, pick her up, take her to the restaurant--", "Why?", "You didn't say anything about that.", "Yes!", "And... what am I supposed to do all that time?", "Nobody.", "You're changing him?", "Judith said Cynthia wouldn't go out with me, and she was wrong, so, [high-pitched]: ha!", "And you were right, sir!

Is-- is this lifestyle actually making you happy?", "You're kidding, right? You have two black eyes and you're perched on a scrotum cozy. [reluctantly]: You.", "Charlie, don't you see what's happening to you?", "Well, then, I guess there's no point in my talking to you anymore.", "You're gonna get married?", "Cooperstown?", "Well, sounds like you've got everything figured out.", "Uh-huh. How many pain pills have you taken?", "I'm here, I figure, what the hell?", "It's a ladies' room. Why do they even go up?", "You were with her [Courtney], weren't you?", "No, I'm the wedding planner.", "So you weren't the one who was...", "I never took any LSD!", "What are you talking about?", "It's Elizabethan.", "Walk.", "Bite me.

That dude we brought to the lab? They shot him right in front of me! Just blew his head open! Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away. Anyway, they've been holding off but from between Cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like what you call a rock and a hard place situation. So Gus is gonna cave. So the Cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula. And he's gonna give it to them. Well, I, I gotta give it to them.

I mean, bye!", "Hey, uh, Fez does that shirt come with its own bicycle pump?", "God, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Carnation Instant Bitch?", "Oh yeah maybe. I'm not really sure how to dial that though.", "You know, I wasn't that worried about Donna and my mom talking about me but now that I'm all paranoid I'm all, like paranoid.

Thanks for the bedtime story.", "No, I got her way more than a piece of jewelry. I got her a gift that really says something - a diamond engagement ring.", "No, you guys, I'm gonna ask Donna to marry me.", "[To Schatzi] Hey Schatzi, stay away from my witch sister.

He keeps calling me a stupid duck. [Jackie looks at Hyde in disbelief. Eric finally gets it and snaps his fingers] Ahhh.", "I don't think this situation calls for camouflage, Kelso.", "Wait, this isn\u2019t like the time you bought a hamster, named it Virginity and then lost it, is it?", "Alive?", "You knocked over my Space Command Center? I spent three hours building that.", "Nothing was going on? Umm, space command centers were ruined!", "Yeah. Hungry: check. Horny: check. It's getting old, Fez.

I'm, like, up to 17 push-ups a night, so..", "No, no, I... Well, yes, yes, I have! [Kelso pulls Eric away.]", "No, man, I don't think so. I think it's because I graduated. Hyde, am I cool now?", "[after fixing the lawnmower] Mom, Dad, come quick. I fixed it. I fixed it!

This is a lot like Luke before he discovered the Force.", "I wonder if she'd like to watch The Graduate with me sometime?", "Dad, you were there for three. [Kitty looks at Red]", "Mitch! Congratulations this seems like the perfect job for someone your size what with the free lodging in the castle on hole six.", "Guys... I have to tell you about this dream I had.", "No. It was about Donna. Okay, it was five years in the future.", "Hyde, in my dream, Donna gave up her life plans to be with me. And she was so miserable, she left me.", "Look, you guys, what if I really am holding Donna back.. and she just doesn't realize it yet? I feel like I could be ruining both of our lives.", "Oh, you know what? Why don't you guys just decide who my best man is?", "Life is like a train. It's barring down on you and guess what? it's gonna hit you. So you can either start running when it's far off in the distance or you can pull up a chair, crack open a beer and just watch it come.", "Okay. okay. Donna, you though the engagement ring was big enough right? [Donna hesitates]", "I can't believe Red bought the muffler shop. Alright, that's it. New Eric's out, Old Eric's back. I should probably just go upstairs and think about what I've done.", "Okay, I'm not following.", "You know what? It is hot. I'm not gonna let Red bully me out of it. I mean, how often was I hot before? Almost never, right?! But now, I am hot, and hot, I will stay. Let's celebrate.", "There's a new sheriff in town, little lady.", "Look, I said I was sorry and I fixed up the shop. Come on Dad, aren't we- aren't we getting a little old for this whole dance? I mean, here we are, shaking our booties and I mean, disco's dead.", "No, I'm saying, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna accept my apology, man to man, and then sit down with me and my girl here, and enjoy this beer.", "Or, here's what's gonna happen. I am going to go to my room. But first, I'm gonna chug this beer.", "Okay, that's really fizzy. But I think I made my point. Now you put some saran wrap on that, and I will finish it later.", "[enters kitchen] Hey, what's for lunch?", "Yeah, so is lunch off or, uhm... I mean, what's the lay of the lunch land here?", "But I'm not. Could I, like... seriously, like a sandwich or...", "[to Red] - I can't believe that I'm saying that, but please make kinky sex with my mother!", "Hey, Hyde, remember how you kept bringing it up, when Kelso nailed my sister. I never understood why, but now I get it. It\u2019s fun! So guess what \u2014 Kelso nailed your sister! Oh, and another thing... Kelso nailed your sister.", "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but Kelso nailed your sister!", "Uh, that's ridiculous. The Jedi don't play football. They play manu-Ka.", "No. You know what?

I'm offended that you would think that (smiles and chuckles as he displays a napkin with her phone number)...All right.", "But I bet you'd like to. Maybe she's not a suspect, maybe...maybe you've got a thing for her. Maybe you're thinking a little too much with your upstairs brain.", "What are you gonna do?", "[laughing] Yeah, you are.", "All right, you little pervert.", "I\u2019m goin\u2019, I\u2019m goin\u2019.", "You wanna go back to school?", "Huh.", "No. No, it\u2019s, uh, great. Good for you.", "It\u2019s never gonna be over. There\u2019s gonna be others.

I mean, why do you think I came and got you at Stanford in the first place?", "Yes, that, but it\u2019s more than that, man. You, me, Dad. I want us to be together again. To be a family again.", "Could be.", "Hey, Sam\u2026?", "Next time you want to get laid\u2026find a girl that's not so buckets of crazy, huh?", "What's the matter, You afraid you gonna get a little Nair in your shampoo again, huh?", "Oh, bring it on, baldy.", "This is exactly why you never get laid.", "What happened?", "I'm thinkin' we missed something.", "[laughing] Wow.", "Well, I'm the one who put the dead fish in their back seat.", "Yeah, truce... at least for the next hundred miles.", "Well, maybe he's [their father] gonna meet us there.", "You're a real smart ass, you know that? [pauses] Don't worry, I'm sure there's something in Fitchberg worth killing.", "Because I'm the oldest... which means I'm always right.", "Yeah, it totally does.", "Yeah, well, first of all, I wasn't gonna open fire at a freakin' pediatrics ward.", "Second, it wouldn't have done any good cause the bastard's bullet-proof unless he's chowing down on something, and third, I wasn't packing, which is probably a good thing, 'cause I probably would have just burned a clip in him just out of principle alone.", "Well, we'll be right in the next room. We're gonna come in with guns, so as soon as we do, you roll off this bed and crawl under it.", "[shakes head] We won't shoot you. We're good shots. We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?", "Have you ever heard a gunshot before?", "This is gonna be a lot louder than in movies so I want you to stay under the bed, cover your ears.

You're both consenting adults.", "Well, I'm not talking about marriage, Sam.", "'Cause then maybe you wouldn't be so cranky all the time.", "You know, seriously, Sam, this isn't just about hooking up, okay? I mean, I, I think that this Sarah girl could be good for you. And I don't mean any disrespect, but I'm\u2014I'm sure that this is about Jessica, right? Now I don't know what it's like to lose somebody like that, but I would think that she would want you to be happy; God forbid, have fun one in awhile. Wouldn't she?", "What's it about? [Sam is silent] Yeah, alright.", "Yeah, well, welcome to our world", "[on cell] How're we gonna waste her?", "Well then how's she still around?", "Sam? (calls him)", "Please tell me you slammed the front door!", "Little girl? What little girl?", "Wasn't the dad looking down at her?

Now we're not with him for more than a couple hours and there's static already?", "Well, good.", "[rolls his eyes] Oh, God.", "What happens if you die? Dad, what happens if you die and we coulda done something about it? You know, I've been thinking, and I think maybe Sammy's right about this one. I think we should do this together. We're stronger as a family, dad, we just are, you know it.", "Yeah, but we saved your ass.", "I am?", "For the last time, what happened to them is not your fault.", "No, it\u2019s not your problem, it\u2019s our problem!", "For what?", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, you kidding me?", "Don't say just in case something happens to you, I don't want to hear that freaking speech, man. Nobody's dying tonight, not us, not that family, nobody. Except that demon. That evil son of a bitch ain't getting any older than tonight, understand me?", "Sam, the only thing you would have ended was your life.", "So, what, you\u2019re just willing to sacrifice yourself, is that it?", "Yeah, well, that\u2019s not gonna happen\u2014not as long as I\u2019m around.", "Sam, I wanna waste it. I do, okay? But it\u2019s not worth dyin\u2019 over.", "I mean it. If huntin\u2019 this demon means you gettin\u2019 yourself killed, then I hope we never find the damn thing.", "You said yourself once\u2026.that no matter what we do, they\u2019re gone. And they\u2019re never comin\u2019 back.", "[emotionally] Sammy, look\u2026the three of us\u2014that\u2019s all we have. And that\u2019s all I have. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m barely holdin\u2019 it together, man. Without you and Dad...", "To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure if we should come.", "Yeah, but last time we saw you, I mean, you did threaten to blast him full of buckshot. Cocked the shotgun and everything.", "Actually, we were counting on it. Gotcha.", "You and dad are a lot more alike then I thought, you know that? You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself for this thing, but you know what? I'm gonna be the one to bury you.", "Let him go, or I swear to God...", "You got to be kidding me.", "You son of a bitch.", "Listen, you mind just getting this over with, because I really can\u2019t stand the monologuing.", "Oh yeah? What\u2019s that?", "I bet you\u2019re real proud of your kids too huh? Oh wait, I forgot, I wasted them.", "(to Sam) Come on, you're the psychic. Give me some ghost whispering or something!", "(to John) Well, you sure know something.", "Come on, Dad. You've got to help me. I've got to get better, I've got to get back in there. You haven't called a soul for help, you haven't even tried. Aren't you going to do anything, aren't you even going to say anything?! I've done everything you've ever asked me, everything. I've given everything I've ever had. Now you're just going to sit there and watch me die? What the hell kind of father are you?!", "Dude, I full-on Swazyed that mother!", "(annoyed) You see me messing with crystals and listening to Yanni?", "That's crap. You always have a choice. You can either roll over and die or you can keep fighting, no matter what.", "Oh, you've got to be kidding me.", "God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party.", "Thanks for not giving up on me Sammy.", "There's no such thing as an honorable death. My corpse is gonna rot in the ground and my family is gonna die!", "Fine I guess. I'm alive.", "Come on, Sam.", "What is it?", "Why?", "This really you talking?", "Why you saying this stuff?", "Yeah dad, you know I will. You're scaring me.", "[pause] No. Nothin'.", "Stop it, Sam.", "Stop askin\u2019 if I need anything, stop askin\u2019 if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay. Really. I promise.", "You know what, you\u2019re right. Come here. I\u2019m gonna lay my head gently on your shoulder. Maybe we can cry, hug \u2013- maybe even slow dance.", "I feel like a freakin' soccer mom.", "[looking around Harvelle's, the barrel of a rifle is placed against his back] Oh God, please let that be a rifle.", "You gotta be kidding me; this guy's no genius. He's a Lynyrd Skynyrd roadie.", "Thanks.", "Hey, man?", "I, uh, I dig the haircut.", "I know what you're thinking, Sam: why did it have to be clowns?

C'mon, you still bust out crying whenever you see Ronald MacDonald television.", "Planes crash, Sam!", "Excuse me. We're looking for a Mr. Cooper. Have you seen him around?", "Oh God, I'm sorry...", "[Aside, to Sam] You wanna give me a little help here?", "No, no I don't...", "Nothing, it's just a little misunderstanding.", "No, no, no, I'm just... Can somebody tell me where Mr. Cooper is? Please?", "Nope. But we really need the work. So... and ah, Sam here's got a thing for the bearded lady.", "Hello?", "What\u2019s the matter? You sound like you just saw a clown.", "I just think it\u2019s really interesting, this sudden obedience you have to Dad. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, what would Dad want me to do?\u201d Sam, you spent your entire life sluggin\u2019 it out with that man. I mean, hell, you picked a fight with him the last time you ever saw him, and now that he\u2019s dead, now you want to make it right? Well, I\u2019m sorry, Sam, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s too little, too late.", "Because I want you to be honest with yourself about this! I\u2019m dealin\u2019 with Dad\u2019s death!

Remind me to beat that buzz-kill out of you later, alright?", "He was just one of those guys... took some terrible beatings... just kept coming. So you're always saying to yourself, he's indestructible, he'll always be around... nothing can kill my Dad. And then just like that...he's gone. Can't talk about this to Sammy--I've gotta keep my game face on. But, ah, the truth is I'm not handling it too well.", "Hmm?", "And I\u2019m supposed to listen to her? We barely know her, Sam. No, thanks. I\u2019ll go with Gordon.", "What are you talking about?", "Shut up, Sam.", "You know, I\u2019m not gonna talk\u2014", "Okay... [He turns around and hits Sam.]", "You\u2019re good. A monster pain in the ass\u2026 but you\u2019re good.", "(to Gordon) I might be like you, and I might not. But you\u2019re the one tied up right now.", "Not yet. (to Gordon) I guess this is goodbye. Well, it\u2019s been real... (punches Gordon) Okay, I\u2019m good now. We can go.", "Sam.", "Clock me one.", "Come on. I won\u2019t even hit you back. Let\u2019s go.", "Let\u2019s go. You get a freebie. Hit me. Come on.", "Think about the hunts we went on,Sammy, our whole lives.", "What if we killed things that didn\u2019t deserve killing? I mean, the way Dad raised us-", "I know he did. But the man wasn\u2019t perfect. And the way he raised us to hate those things? And, man, I hate them. I do. When I killed that vampire at the mill I didn\u2019t even think about it. Hell, I even enjoyed it.", "Well, but every instinct told me to. I was gonna kill her, I was gonna kill them all.", "Yeah. And because you\u2019re a pain in my ass.", "Thanks.", "Come on, Sam, I\u2019m begging you. This is stupid.", "Going to visit mom\u2019s grave? She doesn\u2019t even have a grave. There was no body left after the fire.", "Yeah, put up by her uncle, a man we\u2019ve never met. So you wanna go pay your respects to a slab of granite put up by a stranger? Come on", "Well, then enlighten me, Sam.", "It\u2019s irrational, is what it is.", "Why don\u2019t we swing by the Roadhouse instead? I mean, we haven\u2019t heard on the demon lately. We should be hunting that son of a bitch down.", "Right. I\u2019ll be stuck with those people, making awkward small talk until you show up. No, thanks.", "I don\u2019t know, unholy ground, maybe.", "What? If something evil happened, it could easily poison the ground.

Or the-the Angela girl\u2019s spirit, if it\u2019s powerful enough.", "Well, don\u2019t get too excited, you might pull something.", "Awkward...", "I'm still not getting that powerful 'angry spirit' vibe from Angela. I have been reading this though. [holds up a pink book]", "Yeah, Sam, and if anything, that girl's a little too nice.", "Keep digging, talk to more of her friends.", "You kiddin' me? I have her bestest friend in the whole wide world.", "Burn the bones.", "So?", "Since when are you afraid to get dirty?", "What's dead should stay dead.", "Sam, if you bring Dad's death up one more time, I swear...", "We better get out of here before the cops come. I hear you, okay? Yeah, I'm being an ass and I'm sorry. But right now, we got a freaking zombie running around, we need to figure out how to kill it. Right?", "You're telling me. Come on.", "We can't just waste 'em with a headshot?", "You're telling me there's no lore on how to smoke them?", "Neil, it's your grief counselors. We've come to hug.", "[jokingly] Unless this is where he keeps his porn...", "[knocking aside a grate to reveal a large hole in the wall leading outside] Nah, I think she went out to rent Beaches.", "Yeah. Alright, she, uh... She clipped Matt because he was cheating, right?", "Well, it takes two to, you know... have hardcore sex.", "I've heard of some people doing some pretty desperate things to get laid, but you, you take the cake!...", "Your girlfriend's past her expiration date and we're crazy?", "I figured you were more her type. She had pretty crappy taste in guys.", "You're just too fragile. We'll get it looked at later.", "I'm sorry.", "The way I've been acting. And for Dad. I mean, he was your dad too. And it's my fault that he's gone.", "I know you've been thinking it -- so have I. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out. Back at the hospital, I made a full recovery. It was a miracle. And five minutes later Dad's dead and the Colt's gone.", "You can't tell me there's not a connection there. I don't know how the demon was involved. I don't know how the whole thing went down exactly. But Dad's dead because of me. And that much I do know.", "Sam ... (He starts to cry) You and Dad ... you're the most important people in my life. And now ... I never should've come back, Sam. It wasn't natural. And now look what's come of it. I was dead. And I should have stayed dead. You wanted to know how I was feeling. Well, that's it.", "So tell me. What could you possibly say to make that all right?", "You\u2019ve always been a freak.", "Hey, Dr. Badass!", "REO Speedwagon?", "He sings it from the hair, there's a difference.", "If I ran off with you, I think your mother might kill me.

What\u2019s going on?", "Yeah, thanks.", "Yeah. You know, I just rebuilt her, too. Can\u2019t let a car like this one go.", "Sure, man!", "Hop right in there\u2026there you go.", "All right.", "I know! He just sort of asked me for it, and then I let him take it...", "He full-on Obi-waned me! It's mind control, man!", "Oh, thank God! I'm sorry baby, I'll never leave you again! At least he left the keys in it.", "Well, it looks like he can\u2019t work his mojo just by twitchin\u2019 his nose. He\u2019s gotta use verbal commands.", "And Moby Dick's bong.", "Argh!!! You know, one day I'd love to just sit down, and eat something that I didn't have to microwave in a Mini-Mart.", "We hunt demons.", "Demons, spirits, things your worst nightmares wouldn't even touch. Sam here, he's my brother...", "I'm trying. He's psychic, kinda like you. Well, not really like you, but see he thinks you're a murderer and he's afraid that he's gonna become one himself because you're all part of something that's terrible and I hope to hell that he's wrong, but I'm starting to get a little scared that he might be right.", "Awesome.", "We believe you. But who did?", "No argument here. I\u2019ve had my head screwed with enough for one day.", "That was mind control! That was\u2026that\u2019s like being roofied, man. It doesn\u2019t count.", "I call do-over.", "Who knows how many of them are really out there?", "Young girl\u2019s been kidnapped by an evil cult.", "Katie Holmes.", "We rarely drink before 10, anyway.", "No, but your mom might.", "That\u2019s ectoplasm.

No one in their right mind chooses this life. My dad started me on this when I was so young, I wish I could do something else.", "Yeah, but I\u2019m a little twisted.", "Jo, you\u2019ve got a mother that worries about you, who wants something more for you. Those are good things. You don\u2019t throw things like that away. They might be hard to find later.", "Ah! Should have cleaned the pipes.", "Uh, just wish the pipes were clean.", "(answers the phone) Yeah.", "Ellen.", "She's gonna have to call you back, she taking care of... feminine business.", "Look, we'll get her back.", "The spirit we're hunting, it took her.", "She'll be okay, I promise.", "I'll give it back.", "Yeah, we hardly drink before ten anyway!", "What do you think, Scully, want to check it out?", "No, I'm Mulder.

Anyway, are you hungry?", "For some reason, I could really go for some pea soup.", "Dude, I'm like Dillinger or something.", "Well, what have they got on you?", "Wait - no accessory, nothing?", "[laughs] You're jealous.", "Uh-huh.

I think you did it for yourself\u2026so you wouldn\u2019t have to live without her. But, guess what, she\u2019s gonna have to live without you now. But what if she knew how much it cost?

That\u2019s it, I swear.", "Because it was dad and he begged me not to.", "You think I wanted this? Huh? I wish to God he\u2019d never opened his mouth! And I wouldn\u2019t have to walk around with this screaming in my head all day!", "We do? I\u2019ve been thinking about this, I think we should just lay low, you know? At least for a while. It\u2019d be safer. And that way, I could make sure\u2026", "I never said that.", "I never said that! Damn it, Sam, this whole thing is spinning out of control! Alright? You\u2019re immune to some weirdo demon virus, and I don\u2019t even know what the hell anymore. And you\u2019re pissed at me, and I get it. That\u2019s fine, I deserve it. But we lay low until we figure out our next move, okay?", "Sam, please, man. [He grabs Sam\u2019s shoulder] Hey, please. Just give me some time. Give me some time to think, okay, I\u2019m begging you here. Please\u2026please. [Sam nods]", "[seeing Sam through motel window] Thank God you\u2019re okay. [sees Ava with Sam] Oh, you\u2019re better than okay. Sam, you sly dog!", "[over the phone] Just got here myself. It's a real funky town. You ditched me Sammy!", "Wha- Who?", "I'm staying at 5637 Monroe Street, why don't you meet me here?", "Bite me.", "Well we did leave you tied up in your own mess for three days. [snickers] Which was awesome. Sorry, I shouldn\u2019t laugh.", "Well, you son of a bitch.", "[chuckles] This is a whole new level of moronic, even for you.", "Come on, man, I know Sam, okay, better than anyone. He\u2019s got more of a conscience than I do. The guy feels guilty surfing the Internet for porn.", "[off screen the chair he's sitting on breaks] I'M FREE!", "You're a fine, upstanding citizen, Sam.", "Well, Gordon should be reaching for the soap for the next few years at least.", "Dude, you ever take off like that again...", "That is so not funny.", "One word, Amsterdam.", "Come on, man. I hear the coffee shops don\u2019t even serve coffee", "I can try.", "Bitch.", "Wow, that attitude is just way too healthy for me. I'm officially uncomfortable now. Thank you.", "Dude, this is sweet! I never get to work jobs like this.", "Old-school haunted houses. You know: fog, secret passageways, sissy British accents. We might even get to run into Fred and Daphne while we're inside. Mmm, Daphne...love her.", "That sounds vaguely ominous.", "How'd you know?", "What'd you mean that we look the type?", "Of course, the most troubling question is why do these people assume we're gay?", "(uncomfortable chuckle) Right.", "Hey, are those antique dolls? \u2018Cause this one, this one here, he's got a major doll collection back home. (grins at Sam) Don\u2019t ya? Huh?", "Big time. Yeah, you think he could come\u2026well, we could come in and take a look?", "Please? I mean he loves them. He\u2019s not gonna tell you this, but he\u2019s always dressing \u2018em up in these little tiny outfits and I mean, you\u2019d make his day. She would, huh? Huh?", "Wow! This is a lotta dolls. Er, they're nice, they're not super-creepy at all...", "What?", "Are you drunk?", "You know there's a really good hangover remedy, it's a greasy pork sandwich served up in a dirty ashtray.", "I know you do.", "Hey, it turns out when Grandma Rose was a tyke, she had a Creole nanny who wore a hoodoo necklace.", "Yes I do.", "(groans in disgust) You can brush your teeth first.", "You know, she could be faking.", "You want the truth?", "Well at first we thought it was some kind of hoodoo curse. But that out there, was definitely a spirit.", "That's been said.", "Listen, sister, that car didn't try to run you down by itself, okay? I mean I guess it did, technically, but if a spirit can... forget it.", "Feels good to get back in the saddle, doesn't it?", "(evasive) We talked about a lotta things last night.", "You were wasted.", "Well, thanks, Frannie, I think that's all I need.", "Yeah... Yeah, I think that's a good idea. You're a true patriot, you really are. Why don't you write your number down there for me, that'd be good.", "Frigging cops.", "No, they're doing our job. Only they don't know it, so they suck at it.", "Like from T2.", "Man, that has got to be the kicker, straight up. I mean, you tell that poor son of a bitch that - - Wh-what did you say ? Remand the tapes he copied? Classified evidence of an ongoing investigation? That's messed up.", "No, I just think it's creepy how good of a fed you are. I mean come on, we could at least thrown the guy a bone. He did some pretty good legwork here.", "Except for the mandroid part. I liked him. He's not that different from you and me. People think we're crazy.", "Yeah, I guess.", "Eyes flare at the camera. I hate those freaking things.", "Well yeah, but one didn't turn into you and frame you for murder.", "I like him [the security guard], he says 'okey-dokey'.", "Well, then we follow him home, put a silver bullet in his chest.", "Looks like Mr. Okey-dokey is... okey-dokey.", "And you said we shouldn't bring guns.", "Yeah, just let me do the talking. I don't think he likes you very much, Agent Johnson.", "I'm not just gonna walk in here naked!", "Okay, let's get something straight. It's-it's not a mandroid. It's a shape-shifter.", "Yeah. It's human. More or less. Has human drives, you know. In this case, it's money. But it generates its own skin. It can- it can shape it to match someone else's features. You know. Tall or short or male - -", "Kills 'em, doesn't kill 'em. I don't think it matters. [Taking a knife on the desk.]", "Nice. Remember the old werewolf stories? Pretty much came from these guys. Silver is the only thing I've seen that hurts them. Come on, Ronald.", "Are you nuts?", "Yeah, don\u2019t mention it.", "Actually, I just found a few more. C'mon everybody, let's go, let's go. (pushes more hostages in)", "Yeah, listen, I'm not really in the negotiating mood right now.", "So-", "Whoa. That's kinda harsh for a Federal Agent, don't you think?", "Yeah, well, that part's true, but how'd you even know we were here?", "[darkly] Hey, you don't know crap about my dad.", "You got no right talking about my dad like that. He was a hero.", "[pounds his forehead in frustration as he hangs up the phone.]", "Is that community theater or are you naturally that good?", "We are so screwed.", "Man, you gotta to try this because there really is magic in the magic fingers.", "Oh yeah, you're right. Sounds completely sane.", "You know what, there's a ton of lore on unicorns, too. In fact, I hear that they ride on silver moonbeams, and they shoot rainbows out of their ass!", "That's cute.", "I\u2019m just saying, man, there\u2019s some legends that you just...you file under \u201cBull Crap\u201d.", "Yep.", "Because I\u2019ve never seen one.", "So, I believe in what I can see.", "Exactly, with our own eyes. That\u2019s hard proof, okay? But in all this time, I have never seen anything that looks like an angel. And don\u2019t you think that if they existed, that we would have crossed paths with them, or at least know someone that crossed paths with them? No. This is a demon or a spirit. You know? they find people a few fries short of a Happy Meal and they trick them into killing these randoms.", "Well, I think I learned a valuable lesson. Always take down your Christmas decorations after New Year's, or you might get filleted by hooker from God. HA!", "Did you bring quarters? (Sam glances at the timer)", "What are you talkin' about, I eat!", "Yeah, well you know, we just don't feel right unless we hit church every Sunday. So-", "(interrupting) Freedmont, Texas.", "Sure, yeah... no, it's Father... O'Malley.", "Shaughnessy. Exactly...what did I say?", "Look, I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m a bit of a skeptic. But since when are you all Mr. 700 Club? No, seriously, from the get-go, you\u2019ve been willing to buy this angel crap, man. What's next, you're going to start praying everyday?", "What?", "Things you learn about a guy.", "Okay, ecstasy boy. Maybe we\u2019ll get you some glow sticks and a nice Dr. Seuss hat.", "You know, you\u2019re supposed to be bad, too, Sam. Maybe, maybe I should just stop you right now.", "What, that this is an angel?", "Okay, all right. You know what? I get it. You\u2019ve got faith. That's-hey, good for you. I\u2019m sure it makes things easier. I\u2019ll tell you who else had faith like that \u2013- Mom. She used to tell me when she\u2019d tuck me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, that was the last thing she ever said to me.", "What\u2019s to tell? She was wrong. There was nothing protecting her. There\u2019s no higher power, there\u2019s no God. There\u2019s just chaos and violence and random, unpredictable evil that comes out of nowhere. It rips you to shreds. So, you want me to believe in this stuff? I\u2019m gonna need to see some hard proof. You got any?", "We\u2019ll summon Gregory\u2019s spirit.", "Yeah. You know, we just, we need a few odds and ends, and that s\u00e9ance ritual in Dad\u2019s journal.", "If Father Gregory's spirit is around, the s\u00e9ance will bring him right to us. If it's him, then we'll put him to rest.", "Exactly. It's one of the perks of the job, Sam, we don't have to operate on faith. We can know for sure. Don't you want to know for sure?", "We'll just put it Spongebob-side down.", "Yeah, well, don\u2019t worry about that, all right? I\u2019m watching out for you.", "Maybe what?", "Maybe... God's will.", "Whose is it?", "Sam, what the hell happened?", "You checked in two days ago under the name Richard Sambora. Of course, I think the scariest part about this whole thing is the fact that you\u2019re a Bon Jovi fan.", "Oh, please tell me you didn\u2019t steal this.", "You getting any goose bumps yet? God-this-looks-familiar, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu vibes?", "This guy? (to Sam) You were drinking malt liquor?", "This guy?", "\u2018Cause I\u2019m asking you. Now, please, you\u2019d be doing me a huge favor, okay?", "You saw him (Sam) smoking?", "What\u2019s going on with you, Sam? Hm? \u2018Cause smoking, throwing bottles at people \u2013- I mean, that sounds more like me than you.", "You never told me this.", "Well, bang up job on that.", "No one can control you but you.", "What?", "I didn\u2019t mean this!", "Shut up, Sam!", "No. Listen to me. We\u2019re gonna figure this out, okay? I mean, there\u2019s gotta be a way, right?", "You won\u2019t. Whatever this is\u2026you can fight it.", "You know, I\u2019ve tried so hard to keep you safe.", "I can\u2019t. [beat] I\u2019d rather die. [He drops the gun on the floor.]", "(looks at hooker and customer in hall) Yeah, I bet they do.", "(talking on the phone) Hi, so sorry to bother you but, my son snuck out of the house last night and went to a Justin Timberlake concert.. What?.. yeah.. Justin is quite the triple threat.", "Sam!", "Put the knife down, damn it!", "No, Sammy, come on. [He lowers the gun.]", "Why didn\u2019t you kill me? You had a dozen chances.", "I'll call you later, okay? (leaves)", "How \u2018bout I smack that smartass right outta your mouth?", "No, you won\u2019t be in him long enough. Bobby? [Bobby starts chanting an exorcism] See, whatever bitch-boy master plan you demons are cooking up \u2013- [Sam screams in pain] \u2013- you\u2019re not getting Sam. You understand me? \u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna kill every one of you first.", "Meg.", "Sammy...", "Yeah, right back at ya.", "That sounds vaguely dirty, but er, thanks.", "You OK?", "Sam? Is that you in there?", "It was the right move, Sam. It wasn't you.", "Sam, when Dad told me... that I might have to kill you, it was only if I couldn't save you. Now, if it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna save you.", "[starts to laugh]", "[continues to laugh] Nothing.", "Dude, you [chuckles] you like full on had a girl up inside of you for like a week. [both laugh]That's pretty naughty.", "No, I don't mind. How\u2019s the research going?", "Mm.", "Yeah, absolutely. [He raises the volume louder.]", "[turning the music off] Hey, I\u2019d love to. That\u2019s a great idea. Unfortunately, my car\u2019s all screwed to hell.", "Woah, woah, woah, woah... hold on a minute!!", "C'mon dude, that's not how it happened!", "Yeah maybe that, but I don't say things like \"fiesty little wildcat\" and her name wasn't Starla.", "(pauses) I don't know... but she was a classy chick. She was a grad student. Anthropology and folklore. We were talking about local ghost stories.", "Thanks. But no time for that now. You need to tell me about this urban legend. Please? Lives are at stake.", "No, see, married couples can get divorced. Me and him? We're like, Siamese twins.", "See what I mean?", "...no...", "Why don\u2019t you control your OCD?", "You\u2019ve gotta give those Purple Nurples a shot!", "They probed you?", "[deadpan] Yikes.", "How could it get any worse? Some alien made you his bitch!", "What? You mean some saucer-shaped jet engine?", "You're always saying pansy stuff like that.", "These punishments, they\u2019re almost poetic. Well, actually they\u2019d be more like a limerick, but still\u2026", "Why would I take your computer?", "[smirking] Looks like you lost it, Poindexter.", "What are you talking about? I\u2019m a joy to be around!", "What\u2019s wrong with my food?", "[to himself] I like it.", "It'd be the last thing you ever did.", "It serves him right, but no.", "Oh, that\u2019s right. Yeah, \u2018cause he\u2019s Mister Perfect.", "This couldn\u2019t get any weirder.", "Oh, I\u2019m sure he has. It\u2019s just your typical haunted campus, alien abduction, alligator-in-the-sewer gig. Yeah, it\u2019s simple.", "Oh, no. No. Consider it reparations for emotional trauma.", "No.", "Yeah, right back at ya.", "Get off me!", "What?", "I\u2019ve got nothing.", "[snapping his fingers] That\u2019s what I thought.", "Look man, I gotta tell you, I dig your style, Alright. I mean, I do. I mean\u2026 phew! And the, uh, the slow dancing alien...", "Hey... me too.", "Did he look like he... lost a fight with a lawnmower?", "Lucky guess.", "We weren't just cruisin' for chicks when we ran into you, sister, we were already out here... hunting.", "(pauses) Ghosts.", "Follow the creepy brick road.", "You know, just once I'd like to round the corner and see a nice house.", "Sammy's always gettin' a little J. Love Hewitt when it comes to this. Me, I don't like 'em. And I'm sure as hell ain't makin' apologies for 'em.", "It smells like old lady in here.[after seeing the corpse] And that would explain why.", "[Pauses] You're like a walking encyclopedia of weirdness.", "Call me Dean.", "Yeah, but you are gonna freak him right out.. for life.", "I guess she wasn't so bad. For a ghost. You think she's really going to a better place?", "I guess we'll never know. Not until we take the plunge ourselves, huh?", "Well alright, Haley Joel, let's hit the road.", "And the lunar cycles?", "Which is this week, right?", "Awesome.", "I'm sorry man, but what about a human by day, a freak animal killing machine by moonlight don't you understand? I mean, werewolves are badass. We haven't seen one since we were kids.", "Nah, nothin' but leftovers and a six-pack.", "You go after the creepy ex. I'm gonna hang here with the hot chick.", "Because I'm older.", "Shut up, shut up. Two out of three! [They do rock paper scissors again and Dean chooses scissors and loses again.]", "I found him.", "Oh yeah, my eyes are glued.", "[Walks in and sees Madison tied to a chair.] How you doing? My head feels great, thanks.", "She's lying.", "Like a really hot Incredible Hulk. Come on dude, she ganked her boss and her ex-boyfriend. That doesn't sound rash and unconscious.", "What are you the dog whisperer now?", "Honestly? Ah...We're pretty sure you're not gonna turn tonight, but we gotta be 100%. So...You know, we're...lurking.", "Sammy, check it out. It's Matt Damon.", "No, it is.", "Yeah, well he's probably researching a role or something.", "Like Poltergeist?", "No, no, no, the movie Poltergeist... You know nothing of your cultural heritage, do you?", "What's a PA?", "This map is totally worth the five bucks. Hey, we gotta go check out Joey Ramone's grave when we're done.", "Bite your tongue, heathen.", "(Imitating John McClane) Come out to the coast. We'll get together. Have a few laughs.", "(Taking a mug shot photo) I call this one my Blue Steel.", "Well it's about time. I'll have a cheeseburger...extra onions.", "I think I'm adorable.", "(walking into the prison) Don't worry, Sam. I promise I won't trade you for smokes.", "Pretty sure.", "Really pretty sure.", "Oh great, another guy who's seen Taxi Driver one to many times.", "I said I wish I had a baseball. You know, like Steve McQueen.", "Yeah. So much for the bonding solitary moment.", "(after winning a poker game and collecting the won cigarettes) It's like picking low hanging fruit.", "Are you kidding me? It's the currency of the realm.", "How we gonna get in?", "That's the Sammy I know. Come on, man, you're like Clint Eastwood from 'Escape from Alcatraz'.", "It's a good thing I'm like James Garner from 'The Great Escape'.

Hey, I'd wanna ask you, 'cos I couldn't help but notice that you are two tons of fun. Just curious, is it like thyroid problem or is this some deep seeded self-esteem issue?

Poor giant Tiny.", "No, not really.", "(receiving letter from the lawyer) Would you look at that? I am freaking velvety smooth.", "(after finding Impala outside the prison) Oh man, are you a sight for sore eyes.", "Yeah, yeah, I know, we gotta go deep this time.", "I'm not sure I'm ready to go that deep.", "Sam.", "I don't know. I don't know where I am.", "The Djinn, it.. it attacked me.", "Are you kiddn' me? I love your lectures. You... [thinks, grinning] ... you make learning fun.", "How did I end up with such a cool chick?", "We don't? Well, we should. I mean, you're my brother.", "Yeah!", "Who?", "[under his breath] Yeah, that does kinda sound like me.", "I'm dating a nurse. That is so...respectable.", "[to his Dad's grave] So go hunt the Djinn. It put you here, it could put you back. Your happiness for all these people's lives. No contest. Right? But why? Why is it my job to save these people? Why do I have to be some kind of hero? What about us, huh? What, Mom's not supposed to live her life, Sammy's not supposed to get married.. Why do we have to sacrifice everything, Dad? It's [long pause] yeah.. [walks away]", "[Sam hears someone downstairs and goes looking with a baseball bat. Dean puts him down] That was so easy, I'm embarrassed for you.", "Bitch.", "You're supposed to say Jerk.", "... never mind.", "It wasn't. It was just a wish. I wished for Mom to live. Mom never died, we never went hunting and you and me just never... ya know.", "Don't forget the extra onions this time!", "Hey, see if they've got any pie. Bring me some pie. Love me some pie.", "(just had a vision) That was about as fun as getting kicked in the jewels.", "(to Sam as he's dying, seeing the wound) Look at me. It's not even that bad. It's not even that bad, alright? Sammy? Sam! Hey! Listen to me. We're going to patch you up, okay? You'll be as good as new. Huh? I'm gonna take care of you? I'm going to take care of you; I've got you, that's my job, right? Watch after my pain in the ass little brother. (realizes Sam is already dead) Sam? Sam? Sam?! Sammy?! No. No, no, no, no. Oh no come on. Oh God. (pulls Sam's body against his and yells) SAM!", "[shouting] Well, then let it end!", "[to Sammy, before going to Crossroads] You know, when we were little, you couldn't have been more than five, you'd just started asking questions. How come we didn't have a mom; why do we always have to move around; where'd Dad go.. when he'd take off for days at a time. I remember I begged you, quit askin' Sammy, man, you don't wanna know. I just wanted you to be a kid. Just for a little while longer. I always tried to protect you, keep you safe. Dad didn't even have to tell me. This was always my responsibility, you know. It's like, I had one job. I had one job. And I screwed it up. I blew it. And for that I'm sorry. I guess that's what I do. I let down the people I love. I let Dad down, and now I guess I'm just supposed to let you down too. How can I? How am I supposed to live with that? What am I supposed to do? Sammy... God... What am I supposed to do? [screams] What am I supposed to do?", "Bobby...", "One year.", "Which is why we gotta find this yellow-eyed son of a bitch. Its why I'm gonna kill him myself.

I get one year.", "Don't get mad at me. Don't you do that. I had to look out for you. That's my job!", "What?", "[Drops the spent Colt in the trunk] We got work to do.", "What for?", "It was a beautiful, natural act, Sam.", "Well, sold my soul. Got a year to live. I ain't sweatin' the cholesterol", "Comforting the bereaved. What're you doing?", "(fake coughing) Sam, I'm sorry. It's just, you know, I don't have much time left. And, uh... (more coughing) ...gotta make every second count.", "Well, maybe something. (looks at security camera) See? I\u2019m working.", "No. But I spent all day canvasing this stupid town with this guy's stupid mug, and supposedly he drinks at this stupid bar...", "So what? I'm dead already!", "No, who?", "(laughs) What\u2019s in the box? (silence) Brad Pitt... Se7en... no? (shuts up as Bobby hits him with a book)", "What do you want?", "What\u2019s that?", "I suppose you're Lust.", "Yeah, alright. Just stay back.", "Good point.", "You look like hell warmed over.", "I'm just gonna ask it again... who was that masked chick? Actually, the more troubling question would be, \"How come a girl can fight better than you?\"", "Hey, whatever it takes to get you through the night, pal.", "What's that?", "(pause) You're right. That is troubling.", "That didn't last long.", "Yeah. You\u2019re right. Was selfish. But I\u2019m okay with that.", "Tough. After everything I\u2019ve done for this family, I think I\u2019m entitled.", "I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.", "Eh, whatever.", "I got a year to live, Sam. I\u2019d like to make the most of it. So what do you say we kill some evil sons of bitches and we raise a little hell, huh?", "Very true.", "Dude, you do realize that you\u2019re in a restaurant?", "Okay... Weirdy McWeirderton.", "She was a yoga teacher. That was the bendiest weekend of my life!", "As many as I can squeeze out.", "Come on, smile, Sam. God knows I'm going to be smiling after 24 hours with Gumby girl. (chuckles) Gumby Girl... does that make me Pokey?", "You're not wrong.", "(points to large kid with Ben's game) Is that Humphrey? The one that needs to lay off the burgers?", "What? Somebody had to teach him to kick a bully in the nads.", "We'll just bust in, drag the kids out, torch them in the front lawn. That'll play great with the neighbors.", "Y\u2019know how I never mentioned my job? This is my job.", "You know, just for the record, you got a great kid. I would have been proud to be his dad.", "(reading from trophy) 1995.", "Yeah, it's probably the closest you ever came to being a boy. Oh, wow! It\u2019s my first sawed-off. I made it myself. Sixth grade.", "Exciting, I know.", "Wow! You suck.", "Sam? You okay?", "Nothing, nothing! Come here. I don't want you doing- anything! I want you to sit right here, and don't move! Okay? Don't turn on the light, don't turn off the light, don't even scratch your nose!", "So you\u2019re only out for yourself, huh? It\u2019s all about number one?", "Well, aren\u2019t you a glass half-full?", "If it's any consolation, I think you're a truly awful person.

Okay, you're a thief, fine, but you're not gonna - (Bela shoots Sam) Son of a--!", "What the hell is wrong with you?!?!?!?!", "Wow... I really don't feel bad about that. Sam?", "Oh, don't go away angry. Just go away.", "SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!", "There\u2019s got to be a demon or two in South Beach.", "(about the Colt) So if we wanna go check out these omens in Ohio, think you can have that thing ready by this afternoon?", "(referring to Richie) No way he gets a girl like that. I mean, look at her. You could fit that ass on a nickel.", "I do now.", "What do I look like?", "Oh, I forgot to mention, Richie was a friend of mine. When I realized I could track the GPS on his cell phone I swung by earlier, to give him a proper burial. It's better than rotting in some skank's basement.", "What are you laughing at, bitch? You're still trapped.", "Why do you demons have such smart mouths.", "(trying an exorcism from memory) Spiritus emundi, undalara, persona tote\u2026 (trails off, lost)", "I don't know what you're smiling about, you're not going anywhere.", "Yeah, but I got somebody coming for me and uh... he did pay attention in class.", "Everyone?", "Why don't you kiss my ass?", "Yeah? You did something.", "Lunch?", "That's it?", "And that's how it ends?", "Well, except that, uh, demons are evil.", "He one of yours?", "That\u2019s okay: I mean hey, I barely respect you now.", "Azazel?", "Think something's wrong with my brother?", "(doubtfully) Yeah.", "Hit me.", "Oh, that\u2019s... that's nice. You think about fairy tales often?", "Three little pigs.", "Actually, those guys were a little chubby.", "I thought all those things ended with everyone living happily ever after.", "So you think the murders are what, a re-enactment? That's a little crazy.", "Touch\u00e9.", "All right, maybe it is fairy tales. Totally messed-up fairy tales. I'll tell you one thing, there\u2019s no way I'm kissing a damned frog.", "Yeah? It's close to Halloween.", "Dude! Could you be more gay? Don't answer that.", "Snow White? Ah, I saw that movie. Oh, porn version anyways. There was this wicked Stepmother (hoots) she was wicked.", "You find a way to stop Callie, all right.", "I'm gonna go stop the big bad wolf. Which is the weirdest thing I've ever said.", "See you around, Doc.", "You know what he said. Some good advice.", "So, I've been waiting since Maple Springs. You got something to tell me?", "No.", "There's a bullet missing from the Colt. You want to tell me how that happened? I know it wasn't me, so unless you were shooting at some incredibly evil cans.", "You went after her didn't you? The Crossroads Demon, after I told you not to.", "You could have gotten yourself killed.", "And you shot her?", "What a crazy old broad.", "Ha ha, look at you. Sticking up for your girlfriend, you cougar hound.", "Hey, not if she bites you first.", "So what happens? You see the ship and then a few hours later you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye.", "What's the next step?", "That shouldn't be too hard. I mean, how many three-mast clipper ships have wrecked off the coast?", "Wow!", "Crap.", "This is where we parked the car, right?", "Where's my car?", "Yes, I fed the meter. Sam, where's my car? Somebody stole my car!", "I am calmed down. Somebody stole my c... :(starts to hyperventilate)", "You what?", "No, it wasn't!", "Can I shoot her?", "You really want to come near me when I got a loaded gun in my hands?", "Hey, Bela, how'd you get like this? Huh? What, your daddy not give you enough hugs or something?", "We help people.", "Whoa, hey, no need to get nasty.", "You can't save everybody, Sam.", "No, not really.", "You got to understand\u2026", "If you say \"I told you so,\" I swear to God, I'll start swinging.", "That's assuming you have a heart.", "A Hand of Glory? I think I got one of those at the end of my Thai massage last week.", "(upstairs) I am so not okay with this!", "All right, get it out. I look ridiculous.", "(after thinking hard) Don't objectify me.", "Look. There's security all over this place, alright. This is an uncrashable party, without Gert's invitation, so.", "Yeah I know, but this is easier and it's a lot more entertaining.", "Ah, he's playing hard-to-get. That's cute.", "I\u2019m thinking\u2026", "You think she's a pain in the ass now, try living with her.", "Screw you.", "Oh! Sorry. Uh...Nature called.", "(nodding towards the room Bela's in) Thanks for looking after my wife.", "(to Sam) You stink like sex.", "(about Bela) You know what? You're right. I\u2019m not going to kill her. I think slow torture\u2019s the way to go.", "I can\u2019t BELIEVE she got another one over on us!", "What?", "Thank you, Sam! Very helpful.", "In time for what?", "You what? Wow, you know... I.. I knew you were an immoral, thieving, con-artist bitch, but just when I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower...", "So who was it, Bela? Hmm? Who'd you kill? Was it daddy? Your little sis, maybe?", "No... right. Well, have a nice life, you know whatever's left of it. (grabs jacket) Sam, let's go.", "Watch us.", "Our help? Well, now how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?", "Almost definitely not.", "So ponying up ten grand is easier for you then a simple \u201cthank you\u201d? You're so damaged.", "I think maybe I'll play craps.", "Well, what can I say? I'm a badass.", "Excuse me?", "I don't know, maybe pick up the phone and tell us that a raging psychopath was dropping by?", "He tried to kill us!", "There were two of them.", "Bela, if we make it out of this alive, the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you.", "Listen to my voice, and tell me if I'm serious.", "First things first.", "About that, when we find him or if he finds us..", "Well I'm just saying he's not leaving us a whole lot of options.", "Really? Just like that? I thought you would have been like; \"No we can't, he's a human, it's wrong.\"", "Well...there's Hell.", "It's like a giant haystack and Gordon's a deadly needle.", "It\u2019s just another day at the office. It\u2019s a massively dangerous day at the office.", "Whoa, whoa. Kamikaze? I'm more like a ninja.", "It's a little funny.", "What do you want me to do, Sam, huh? Sit around all day writing sad poems about how I\u2019m going to die? You know what, I\u2019ve got one. Let\u2019s see, what rhymes with \"Shut up, Sam\"?", "I'm not!", "You got no idea what you're talking about.", "And how do you know that?", "Really?", "What?", "(to Sam) You just charged a super-vamped-out Gordon with no weapon. That's a little reckless, don't you think?", "Yeah, I do. You fix it.", "Well, it's time. You should know how to fix it. You're going to need to know these things for the future. And besides, it's my job, right. Show my little brother the ropes.", "So was I right, was it the serial killing chimney-sweep?", "Who?", "Who's that?", "So what the hell do you think we're dealing with?", "Yeah?", "What could you possibly say that's gonna sound crazy to me?", "Yeah, that's crazy.", "By hauling their ass up chimneys.", "So this is your theory, huh? Santa's shady brother?", "What are you talking about? We had some great Christmases.", "Oh, come on, Sam.", "All right, Grinch.", "Um, no. Uh, but actually, uh, my brother here, it's been a life long dream of his.", "[to Sam] Why are you the boy that hates Christmas?", "Oh, yeah. That'd be great. Me and myself making cranberry molds.", "What's up with Saint nicotine?", "What?", "Wreaths, huh? Sure you didn't want to ask her about her shoes? I saw some nice handbags in the foyer.", "What'd Bobby say?", "Christmas is Jesus' birthday.", "How do you know that? What're you gonna tell me next...the Easter Bunny's Jewish?", "Great.", "Lap dances, hopefully.", "We were playing Jenga over at the Walsh's the other night, and, uh, well he hasn't shut up since about this Christmas wreath. I don't know. (looks over to Sam) You tell him.", "Do you sell them for free?", "That's the spirit.", "Well, yeah. This is my last year.", "What do you mean?", "Yeah, I think so.", "Aah! You bitch!", "I'll try and remember that.", "You fudging touch me again, I'll fudging kill you!", "[muffled, because of the pair of tongs in his mouth] So are you gonna get that?", "You should get that.", "(holding up Sam's presents) Look at this. Fuel for me and fuel for my baby!", "I hate witches. They're always spewing their body liquids everywhere.", "It's creepy. Hell, it's downright unsanitary!", "Freakin' witches!", "Why does a rabbit always get screwed in the deal? Poor little guy.", "I'd like to report a dead body. At 309 Mayfair Circle. My name? Yeah sure my name is...(hangs up)", "They killed the nut job, should we, uh, thank them or what?", "Stopped like stopped? They're human, Sam.", "Burn, witch, burn.", "What the hell were you thinking?", "She's a demon, Sam. Period. Alright? They want us dead, we want them dead!", "No! We kill her before she kills us.", "Whatever works.", "Are you feeling okay?", "'Cos you're taking advice from a demon for starters. And by the way, you seem less and less worried about offing people, you know, it used to eat you up inside.", "Nothing, but it's just what you're supposed to do, we're supposed to drive in the friggin car, and friggin argue about this stuff. You know, you go on about the sanctity of life and all that crap.", "No, not mad, I'm-I'm...I'm worried, Sam. Because you're not acting yourself.", "Change into what?", "You want to kill me. Get in line, bitch!", "You saved my life.", "What was that stuff? God, it was ass. It tasted like ass.", "(mutters) You're the short bus, short bus...", "So let me get this straight. You were human once. You died, you went to hell, and you became a...", "Sorry?", "There's no way of saving me from the pit, is there?", "Why'd you tell Sam that you could?", "Ruby? Why do you want us to win?", "What what's like?", "There you are. What are you doing?", "It's two in the afternoon. Drinking whiskey?", "No, you don't.", "What I've been telling you.", "I don't know, unless he was taking an extremely lame vacation.", "Totally. (pause) I mean, no.", "I take it we believe the legends.", "Yeah, why not? Maybe we could help.", "How bad could it be?", "Dude... it's Bobby!", "Crap...", "Bela.", "I'm feeling dirty just thinking about it, but yeah.", "(to sleeping Sam) Sam, wake up! (after Sam woke up from his dream of having sex with Bela) Dude, you were out... and making some serious happy noises. Who were you dreaming about?", "Come on, you can tell me. Angelina Jolie?", "Brad Pitt?", "Well, shall we dim the lights and sync up Wizard of Oz to Dark Side of the Moon?", "What did you do during college?", "Aw, I don't know. It wasn't that dumb.", "I was thirsty.", "Just shut up!", "I mean it, I'm getting angry.", "Son of a bitch! My father was an obsessed bastard! All that crap he dumped on me about protecting Sam, that was his crap! He's the one who couldn't protect his family! He... He's the one who let mom die; who wasn't there for Sam, I always was! He wasn't fair! I didn't deserve what he put on me and I don't deserve to go to hell!", "Sam?", "I've been doing some thinking. And well, the thing is, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna go to Hell.", "Okay, good.", "Rise and shine, Sammy!", "Aw, come on, you love this song and you know it.", "I'm telling you Sam, this job is small fry. We should be spending our time hunting down Bella.", "Shut up.", "Yeah? Clowns or midgets?", "Yeah. No, good. You're totally balanced.", "Sammy, I get all tingly when you take control like that.", "Did it look cool, like in the movies?", "Of course, I peed myself. Man gets hits by a car, you think he has full control over his bladder? Come on!", "You mean we can't even go out for breakfast?", "Whatever that means.", "Do these tacos taste funny to you?", "So you think you're caught in some kinda... what again?", "Yeah, which usually comes after Tuesday. Turn that thing off, would ya?", "No! Geez, how many Tuesdays did you have?", "I don't know, what? Whether Cialis will help you with your little condition?", "You kinky son of a bitch, we don't swing that way!", "It's like we got a contract on us. You think it's 'cause we're so awesome? I think it's 'cause we're so awesome.", "(Country accent) Well, howdy there sheriff.", "But you didn't shoot the deputy. (smirks)", "I owe you the biggest \"I told you so\" ever.", "Salt. Lots and lots of salt.", "What is there an echo in here?", "F.Y.I. Ghosts are real too. So are werewolves. Vampires. Changelings. Evil clowns that eat people.", "If it makes you feel better, Big Foot's a hoax.", "What's that?", "Okay, what do we need to do?", "I got virtue.", "Ha ha. Nobody's a virgin! [Everyone looks at Nancy] No... No way! You're kidding me, right? You're...", "Wait. So you-you've never... Not even once...I mean not even...Wow...", "Stop! Stop! Nobody kill any virgins!", "(to Sam) I'm not going to let that demon kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl, who hasn't even been laid. I mean if that's how you win wars, then I don't want to win.", "I got a plan. I'm not saying it's a good one, I'm not even saying it will work. But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin.", "Open the doors, we let 'em all in, and we fight.", "Crap. Crap. Taxidermy, kay. You said Daggett was a hospital janitor?", "Eew. We got three toe tags here. One, death by gunshots, train accident, and suicide.", "Daggett brought the remains home from the morgue to play with.", "There's some salt in my duffel bag. Make a circle and get inside.", "In the salt, you idiot!!", "What, has he never heard of a Real Doll?", "You know I kind of think it was half awesome.", "Yeah. That's a real tight rope you guys are walking.", "A straight-jacket. Or a punch in the face. Sometimes both.", "...They got us there.", "Well, we'll see you guys around.", "I just talked to an 84-year-old grandmother who's having phone sex with her husband. Who died in Korea.", "Completely rocked my understanding of the word necrophilia.", "I guess I'm big game, you know? My ass is too sweet to let out of sight.", "Then what is it?", "Is that a sandwich?", "The only person who can get me out of this thing is me.", "\"And me\"?", "Deep revelation, having a real moment here. That's what you come back with? \"And me\"?", "Moment's gone. Unbelievable.", "I mean obviously I wanna hunt some zombies.", "Excuse me? No, no. We're very smart!", "Of course we did. Oh, it was-it was riveting, a real page-turner. Just delightful.", "I think so.", "Okay.", "That's weird?", "Good times.", "Dude, I'm eating.", "Dude, I'm eating!", "(to his burger) No, baby, I can't stay mad at you.", "We'll, shoot the hellhounds then, before they slash me up! Now, you comin' or not?", "No, you're not. Cause I'm not gonna let you go wander out into the woods alone to track some some organ-stealing freak!", "Hiya, Bela. Here's a fun fact you may not know: I felt your hand in my pocket when you swiped that motel receipt.", "Oh, I'm pretty sure I understand perfectly. Y'see, I noticed something interesting in your hotel room. Something tucked above the door, an herb. Devil's Shoestring. Well there's only one use for that. Holding Hellhounds at bay. So you know what I did? I went back and took another look at your folks obit, turns out they died ten years ago today. You didn't kill them. A demon did your dirty work. You made a deal, didn't you, Bela. And it's come due.", "Is that why you stole the Colt, huh? Try to wiggle out of your deal? Our gun for your soul?", "But stealing the Colt wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.", "[sarcastic] Really. Wow. Demons, untrustworthy. Huh. Shocker. That's, uh, kind of a tight deadline too, uh, what time is it? Oh, look at that! Almost midnight.", "Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.", "You know what, you're right. You don't. But you know what the bitch of the bunch is? If you would have just come to us sooner and asked for help, we probably could have taken the Colt and saved you.", "And who told you that?", "She?", "...Lilith? Why should I believe you?", "This can't help you, Bela. Not now. Why are you tellin' me this?", "[long pause] I'll see you in Hell.", "Why don't we just make a T.J. run. You know, some se\u00f1oritas, cervezas, uh, we could, what's Spanish for \"donkey show\"?", "We're going off of Bela's intel? Now, when that bitch breathes, the air comes out crooked.", "And I wish you'd shut your pie-hole, but we don't always get what we want.", "Sammy, all I'm saying is that you're my weak spot. You are. And I'm yours.", "I know. And those evil sons of bitches know it, too.", "We got the knife.", "This is about me... and Sam. Ok? This isn't your fight.", "If this is my last day on earth, I do not want it to be socially awkward.", "Little less new agey please.", "Whoa.", "Nothing, I, I just, I, uh, I couldn't see it before, but you are one ugly broad.", "Yes, you are! Yes, you are! I'm sorry! I mean this is all my fault. I know that. But what you're doing, it's not gonna save me. It's only gonna kill you.", "Keep fighting.", "Surprise.", "Yeah, me neither. But here I am. [Suddenly, Bobby attacks Dean.] Bobby! Bobby! It's me!", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed... you're about the closest thing I have to a father. Bobby. It's me. I am not a shapeshifter!", "All right. If I was either, could I do this... with a silver knife? [cuts his arm]", "That's what I've been trying to tell you.", "Yeah, you too.", "I don't know. I just, uh, I just woke up in a pine box...", "I'm not a demon either, you know.", "Yeah. Yeah, you're preachin' to the choir.", "I know, I should look like a Thriller video reject.", "Not much. I remember I was a Hellhound's chew toy, and then... lights out. Then I come to six feet under, that was it.", "Where's what?", "I think we got the wrong room.", "Heya, Sammy.", "Like you didn't do this?", "I know. I look fantastic, huh? (Sam and Dean hug)", "So tell me, what'd it cost?", "It's okay, Sammy. You don't have to apologize, I believe you.", "If he didn't pull me out, then what did?", "I'm a little hungry.", "(points to an iPod in his car) What the hell is that?", "You were supposed to take care of her, not douche her up.", "Who's Jesse? [referring to the text \"Jesse Forever\", which is tattooed on Pamela's lower back]", "His loss.", "Dude, I'm so in.", "Hey, I just got out of jail. Bring it.", "(to Sam) You are NOT invited.", "Whoa. Well, he didn't touch me there.", "That's me.", "I like to think it's because of my perky nipples.", "That's a hell of an art project you've got going there.", "Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife. I mean, we're pretty much set to catch and kill anything I've ever heard of.", "Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first ten times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell?", "You sure you did the ritual right? [Bobby gives him a look] Sorry. Touchy, touchy, huh?", "Who are you?", "Who are you?", "Yeah, I figured that much, I mean what are you?", "Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.", "Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.", "You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking? (Castiel nods.) Buddy, next time, lower the volume.", "And what visage are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?", "You're possessing some poor bastard?", "Look pal, I'm not buying what you're selling, so who are you really?", "Right. And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?", "Not in my experience.", "Why'd you do it?", "Look, all I know is I was not groped by an angel.", "Don't you think that if angels were real, that some hunter somewhere would have seen one... at some point...ever?", "I'm trying to come up with a theory here. Okay? Work with me.", "Yeah, one with a little less fairy dust on it, please.", "I mean, I've saved some people, okay? I figured that made up for the-for the stealing and the-and the ditching chicks. But why do I deserve to get saved? I'm just a regular guy.", "Well, that creeps me out. I mean, I don't like getting singled out at birthday parties... much less by... God.", "You're gonna get me some pie.", "Dude?", "Where's the pie?", "Olivia was rocking the EMF meter.", "Yeah... On steroids. I've never seen a ghost do this to a person.", "Good. We could use their help.", "Come out, come out, whoever you are.", "Meg.", "You're the girl the demon possessed.", "Sorry.", "Well, we thought...", "I'm sorry.", "Bobby.", "You're awesome!", "See, this is why I can't get behind God.", "If he doesn't exist, fine. Bad crap happens to good people. That's how it is. There's no rhyme or reason. Just random, horrible, evil. I get it, okay. I can roll with that. But if he is out there, what's wrong with him? Where the hell is he while all these decent people are getting torn to shreds? How does he live with himself? You know, why doesn't he help?", "Road trip. Grand canyon, Star Trek experience. Bunny ranch.", "Any chance you got everything we need here in this room?", "That's just not as appealing as a ghost-proof panic room, you know?", "Ronald. Hey, come on, man. I thought we were pals.", "Well... come on, I'm not a cheeseburger.", "You were hip to all this?", "Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest.", "I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos -- You know, Michael Landon. Not dicks.", "Yeah? Then, why didn't you fight?", "Concerns? There were people getting torn to shreds down here! And, by the way, while all this is going on, where the hell is your boss, huh, if there is a God?", "I'm not convinced. 'Cause if there's a God, what the hell is he waiting for, huh? Genocide? Monsters roaming the earth? The freaking Apocalypse? At what point does he lift a damn finger and help the poor bastards that are stuck down here?", "If you say \"mysterious ways,\" so help me, I will kick your ass. So, Bobby was right... about the witnesses... this is some kind of a... sign of the Apocalypse.", "Do I want to know what kind of things?", "Okay. I'm guessing that's not a show at Seaworld.", "She did the spell. She rose the witnesses.", "Of course. She picked victims that the hunters couldn't save so that they would barrel right after us.", "Well, we put those spirits back to rest.", "Why break the seal anyway?", "... Okay. Last one opens and...", "Lucifer? But I thought Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday school. There's no such thing.", "To stop Lucifer.", "Well... bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses. That's nice.", "What, do you get your freak on by watching other people sleep? What do you want?", "Can you, uh, tell me where I can get reception on this thing? (referring to his cell phone)", "Thanks...nice threads. You know Sonny and Cher broke up right?", "What is this?", "Is it real?", "Okay, so what? Angels got their hands on some Deloreans? How did I get here?", "Well bend it back or tell me what the hell I'm doing here!", "Stop what? Huh? What, is there something nasty after my Dad?Dean turns as a car horn sounds. When he turns back Castiel is gone. Oh, come on! What, are you allergic to straight answers, you son of a bitch?!", "Sammy, wherever you are, Mom is a babe. I'm going to Hell. Again.", "Samuel and Deanna?", "What about the rest of the town? Well, did you find anything on the web? ...of information that you have assembled.", "By mail?", "The Lord is funny that way. Beth Whitshire, this is my associate, our senior- senior priest, Father Chaney.", "I know you guys think I'm crazy.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. No, I'm fine. Hey, Mary? Can I tell you something?", "Even if this sounds really weird, will you promise me that you will remember?", "On November 2nd, 1983, don't get out of bed. No matter what you hear, or what you see. Promise me you won't get out of bed.", "So what? God's my copilot is that it? Castiel just looks at him, and Dean glances over again. Well, you're a regular chatty Kathy. Tell me something, Sam would have wanted in on this, why not bring him back?", "And you don't care that he's tearing up the future looking for me right now?", "Alright, if I do this, then the family curse breaks right? Mom and Dad live happily ever after, and- and, Sam and I grow up playing little league and chasing tail?", "I realize.", "Oh, I care. I care a lot, but these are my parents, I'm not gonna let them die again. I can't, no, not if I can stop it.", "For what? So they can lead your discount demon army? Is that your big plan?", "I couldn't stop any of it. She still made the deal. She still died in the nursery didn't she?", "What?", "So... Anything you wanna tell me, Sam?", "You gonna say, \"let me explain\"? You gonna explain this? How about this? Why don't you start with who she is, and what the hell is she doing here?", "Well, aren't you an obedient little bitch?", "You don't need me. You and Ruby go fight demons.", "Do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone? How far from normal? From human?", "With your mind! What else can you do?", "What else can you do?!", "And I have every reason in the world to believe that.", "The other side?", "Use the knife!", "That what Ruby want you to think? Huh? Kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers? Slippery slope, brother. Just wait and see. Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and God knows where it ends.", "It's already gone too far, Sam. If I didn't you know... I would wanna hunt you. And so would other hunters.", "Well, tell me. If it's so terrific... then why'd you lie about it to me? Why did an angel tell me to stop you?", "Cas' said that if I don't stop you, he will. See what that means, Sam? That means that God doesn't want you doing this. So, are you just gonna stand there and tell me everything is all good?", "You've been saying that a lot lately, Sam. But whatever. You don't want to tell me, you don't have to. It's fine.", "Are you sure that's him?", "And we're looking for...", "Weird?", "Alright, well, yeah, I've seen big weird, little weird, weird with crazy on top. But this guy? I mean, come on, this guy's boring.", "Yep, sure is.", "Well, he had a hell of a case of the munchies, topped off with a burger that he forgot to cook.", "A rougarou? Is that made up? That sounds made up.", "Hungry for what?", "(doesn't get it) Long pig?", "And that is my word of the day!", "Sam loves research. He does. He keeps it under his mattress right next to his KY.", "Like what?", "I do not.", "Do you know the difference, Sam? I mean, you've been kind of strolling a dark road lately.", "Well then enlighten me!", "You did the right thing, you know. That guy was a monster, there was no going back. Sam, I wanna tell you I'm sorry. I've been kind of hard on you lately.", "It's just that your, uh, your psychic thing, it scares the crap out of me.", "Wait. What? You don't want to talk? You?", "Why don't you try?", "Not alone.", "Really? Well, that's a relief. Thank you.", "Where are you going?", "It's like the good old days! An honest-to-goodness monster hunt! It's about time the Winchesters got back to tackling a straightforward, black-and-white case.", "We still got to see the new \"raiders\" movie.", "Without me?", "That's no excuse!", "Guten Tag yourself.", "I'm a maverick, ma'am. A rebel with a badge. One thing I don't play by- the rules.", "Okay, right. And by that you mean...", "So...he looked like-", "I've been re-hymenated!", "Brother, I have been re-hymenated. And the dude will not abide.", "I don't think we're staying on the case.", "Not weird enough.", "Although, if I was turning life into a movie, I wouldn't do this Abbot and Costello meet the Monsters crap.", "Heh, no, you don't.", "No, you don't. You don't.", "What?", "Lucky guess.", "Run! It'll kill you!", "Oh, I'm not carrying that. (Sam gives him a look) It could go off. (grabs a flashlight) I'll man the flashlight.", "(Lets out a long, girly scream) That was scary!", "What are we doing?", "A ghost, exactly. Who does that?", "Us, right. And that Sam that is exactly why our lives suck. I mean, C\u2019mon, we hunt monsters! What the hell? I mean, normal people, they see a monster and they run. But not us, no no no, we...we search out things that want to kill us! Yeah, huh? Or eat us! You know who does that? Crazy people! We ... are insane! You know, then there\u2019s the crappy diner food and the-and the skivvy motel rooms and then truck stop waitress with the bizarre rash. I mean, who wants this life, Sam? Huh? Seriously! I mean do you actually like being stuck in a car with me eight hours a day every single day? I don\u2019t think so! I mean, I drive too fast and I listen to the same five albums over and over and over again and I- and I-I sing along, I\u2019m annoying, I know that. And you\u2026you\u2019re gassy! You eat half a burrito and you get toxic! I mean, You know what, you can forget it.", "Stay away from me Sam, okay? Because I am done with it. I'm done with the monsters and the-and the-and the hell hounds and the Ghost Sickness and the damn apocalypse. I\u2019m out, I\u2019m done, I quit.", "Fine.", "I'm fine. What? You want to go hunt? I'll hunt...I'll kill anything.", "It's Halloween, man.", "Don't be a downer. Anything interesting?", "This Luke Wallace - he was so vanilla that he made vanilla seem spicy. I can't find any reason why somebody would want this guy dead.", "Raising what, exactly?", "So we're talking ghosts.", "Zombies.", "Leprechauns?", "Those little dudes are scary. Small hands.", "Yeah, well, if you were a six-hundred-year-old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in, wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader? I would. Mmm.", "Sam! Sam, wait! It\u2019s Castiel. The angel. Him, I don\u2019t know.", "Yeah, okay, chuckles. Who\u2019s your friend?", "Why?", "Yes, we\u2019ve located the witch.", "We know who it is.", "We\u2019re working on it.", "What do you care?", "So this is about your buddy Lucifer.", "It\u2019s just an expression.", "Okay, great, well now that you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you tell us where the witch is, we\u2019ll gank her and everybody goes home.", "Okay, who are you and why should I care?", "What kind of specialist? What are you gonna do?", "Why?", "So this is your plan, you\u2019re gonna smite the whole friggin\u2019 town?", "Regrettable?", "So you screw the pooch on some seals and now this town has to pay the price?", "Right, cause you\u2019re bigger picture kind of guys.", "Of course you have a choice, I mean, come on, what? You\u2019ve never-you've never questioned a crap order, huh? What are you both just a couple of hammers?", "Oh, it must be nice, to be so sure of yourselves.", "Well sorry boys, looks like the plans have changed.", "No, but if you\u2019re gonna smite this whole town, then you\u2019re gonna have to smite us with it, because we are not leaving. See, you went to the trouble of busting me out of hell, I figure I\u2019m worth something to the man upstairs. You wanna waste me? Go ahead, see how he digs that.", "Yeah, but you\u2019ll have to kill me, then we\u2019re back to the same problem. I mean, come on, you're gonna wipe out a whole town for one little witch. Sounds to me like you're compensating for something. We can do this, we will find that witch and we will stop the summoning.", "Astronaut!", "What, the angels?", "Well, I tried to tell you.", "Well, they are righteous. That's kinda the problem. Course, there's nothing more dangerous than some a-hole who thinks he's on a holy mission.", "Don't give up on this stuff, is all I'm saying. I mean, Babe Ruth was a dick, but baseball's still a beautiful game.", "Well, are you gonna figure out a way to find this witch, or are you just gonna sit there fingering your bone?", "Zombie-ghost orgy, huh? Well, that's it. I'm torching everybody.", "Let me guess you\u2019re here for the, I told you so.", "Well, good cause I\u2019m really not that interested.", "Then why are you here?", "Yeah, you know, I\u2019ve had about enough of these orders of yours-", "Your orders were to follow my orders?", "It was a witch, not the Tet Offensive. So I uh- failed your test, huh? I get it. But you know what? If you would have waved that-that magic time traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again, I\u2019d make the same call. Cause see, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen when these seals are broken, hell I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is, that this, here? These kids, the swings, the trees, all of it is still here because of my brother and me.", "You were?", "Okay.", "Maybe because he's a dick. Might have something to do with it.", "I don't remember a thing from my time down under. I don't remember, Sam!", "You know everything I do. Okay? That's all there is.", "Women? Showers? (Dean throws money on the table to pay the bill) We gotta save these people!", "I got to tell you, I'm pretty disappointed.", "Damn right I wanted to save some naked women.", "\"Run, Forrest, Run!\"", "Well, maybe somebody's pumping LSD into the town water supply.", "So,what... Bigfoot breaks into a liquor store, jonesing for some hooch? Amaretto and Irish cream. He's a girl-Drink drunk.", "He took the whole porno rack? Well, I'll say it again. What the hell is going on in this town?", "I got nothing.", "Or it's a Bigfoot. You know, and he's some kind of a alcoholo-Porno addict. Kind of like a deep-Woods Duchovny.", "A little young for Busty Asian Beauties.", "What is this, like a Harry and the Hendersons deal?", "Wow. Uh... Amazing. 'Cause you know what? We... Are, uh... Teddy bear doctors.", "Sure. Yeah.", "(incredulously, looking at Teddy Bear) Not really.", "(also whispering) How, huh? Shoot it? Burn it?", "Well we dunno if that's even gonna work, an' I don't-I don't want some giant, flaming, pissed off teddy on our hands.", "Lollipop disease.", "It's not uncommon for a bear his size, but see it's, it's really contagious.", "Shh! [throws a coin] Not supposed to tell.", "That'd be me.", "What are we supposed to do, huh? Stop people's wishes from coming true? I mean, Sounds like kind of a douchey thing to do.", "Well, I am certainly not gonna eat the inside food here. Health department. You, my friend, have a rat infestation. We're gonna have to shut this place down under emergency hazard code 56c.", "Oh, come on. Aren't you a little bit tempted?", "I don't know. That bear seemed pretty real.", "Come on, if you could wish yourself back, you know, before it all started... Think about it. You'd be some big yuppie lawyer with a nice car and a white picket fence.", "Seriously?", "All right, well, what, then? Hmm? What would Sammy wish for?", "The wishes turn bad, Sam. The wishes turn very bad.", "What? I'm up. What?", "Yeah. Tan, rested, and ready.", "See what?", "Sam, please.", "What do you want from me, huh? What?", "Careful what you wish for.", "Come on, can we stow the couples therapy, huh? We're on a job. I want to work. What do you got? Please?", "Plus FBI. And on Thursdays, we're teddy bear doctors.", "We are miserable. We never get what we want. In fact, we have to fight tooth and nail just to keep whatever it is we got.", "Yeah, people are people 'cause they're miserable bastards, 'cause they never get what they really want.", "Just take a look at Michael Jackson, hmm? Or Hasselhoff.", "Okay, man, no more! No more, okay? I wouldn't mess with this kid any more if I were you.", "You were right. I shouldn't have lied to you. I do remember everything that happened to me in the pit. Everything.", "No. I won't lie anymore, but I'm not going to talk about it.", "How? Do you really think that a little heart-to-heart, some sharing and caring, is gonna change anything? Hmm? Somehow... heal me? I'm not talking about a bad day here.", "The things that I saw... there aren't words. There is no forgetting. There's no making it better. Because it is right here... Forever. You wouldn't understand. And I could never make you understand. So I am sorry.", "Right, 'cause as far as you're concerned that Hell-bitch is practically family. Boy, something major must have happened while I was downstairs, 'cause I come back and you're-and you're BFF with a demon?", "Well thanks for the thumbnail. Real vivid. You want to fill in a little detail?", "That's Revelations.", "It's,a uh\u2026 a little-known translation.", "Alastair?", "Sam?", "Too much information.", "Yeah, well, now I feel dirty. Okay, well, uh, brain-stabbing imagery aside... So far, all you've told me about is a manipulative bitch who, uh, screwed you, played mind games with you, and did everything in the book to get you to go bad.", "Just... Skip the nudity, please.", "I guess I...uh... you know?", "I guess I owe you. For Sam, I just...you know", "Okay then. Is the moment over? Good, cause that was awkward.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I know she\u2019s wiretapping your angel chats or whatever but that\u2019s no reason to gank her.", "Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate.", "Iron walls drenched in salt. Demon\u2019s can\u2019t even touch the joint.", "Ahh, Dominican. He said if we break anything we buy it.", "God, I hope so. Otherwise, he's at hedonism in a banana hammock and a trucker cap.", "Who was? The plumber, hmmm? A little snake in the pipes?", "So, you just forgot you were God\u2019s little Power Ranger?", "That\u2019s another question why would you fall? Why would you want to be one of us?", "I don\u2019t? A bunch of miserable bastards; I mean, eating, crapping, confused, afraid-", "Pain-", "Guilt-", "Yeah, you got me there.", "Nothing. It's just\u2026 an angel and a demon, riding in the back seat. It's like the setup to a bad joke. Or a Penthouse Forum letter.", "You call this reality?", "What was that for?", "You're stealing my best line.", "Don't normally see you off leash. Where's your boss?", "Well, what are you guys waiting for? Go get Anna... Unless, of course, you're scared.", "Oh, it looks over to me, junkless.", "I know you heard him.", "Alastair. What he said... About how I had promise.", "You're not curious?", "It wasn't four months, you know.", "It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know. Time's different. It was more like 40 years.", "They, uh... They sliced and carved and tore me in ways that you... until there was nothing left. And then, suddenly... I would be whole again... Like magic... Just so they could start in all over. And Alastair... At the end of every day... every one... He would come over. And he would make me an offer. To take me off the rack... If I put souls on...if I started the torture. And every day, I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For 30 years, I told him. But then I couldn't do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn't. And I got off that rack. God help me, I got right off it, and I started ripping them apart. I lost count of how many souls. The... the things that I did to them.", "How I feel... This... inside me... I wish I couldn't feel anything, Sammy I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing.", "What's it look like I'm doing?", "Yahtzee.", "Boy, three bedrooms, two baths, and one homicide. This place is gonna sell like hotcakes.", "Know-It-All.", "What?", "What?", "Well, that's super disturbing.", "By who? Unless Bill Gibson likes to play with doll heads.", "Crap! So, what now?", "Really?", "What kind of ghost messes with a man's wheels?!?", "That's right.", "Better.", "Please nobody grab my leg, please nobody grab my leg!", "No, you're right. I wasn't like them. I was worse. They were animals, Sam. Defending territory. Me? I did it for the sheer pleasure.", "I enjoyed it, Sam. They took me off the rack, and I tortured souls, and I liked it. All those years; all that pain. Finally getting to deal some out yourself... I didn't care who they put in front of me, because that-that pain I felt, it just slipped away. No matter how many people I save, I can't change that. I can't fill this hole. Not ever.", "What a douchebag.", "I don't even want to know how you know that.", "For what, douchebaggery?", "I can't believe people actually fall for that crap.", "What part of that was not a steaming pile of B.S.?", "Oh, right, right, I forgot, you were actually into this stuff, weren\u2019t you? I mean, you had like a deck of cards and a wand?", "Couldn\u2019t agree more.", "There's been a misunderstanding. I, uh, think I've been had.", "Find anything interesting?", "Nothin\u2019 I wanna talk about...or think about ever again.", "The Chief, huh?", "Y\u2019know, I could have you both arrested for obstruction of justice.", "You got us. Yeah, we-we are actually...aspiring magicians.", "Yeah, get some ideas for our new show.", "It\u2019s-it\u2019s, ah...", "Yeah! Yeah, you know with rings and doves and...rings.", "What?", "Haven't we both already?", "No. I think we'll be dead. For good. Why, do you want to end up like... like Travis? Or Gordon, maybe?", "Oh yeah, there's a poster child for growing old gracefully.", "Well the problem with the snake is that it has a thousand heads. Evil bitches just keep piling out of the Volkswagen.", "Yeah, it\u2019s time we had a little chat with Jay.

The secrets.", "Your phone calls to Ruby, for one.", "That\u2019s the point. You\u2019re hiding things from me. What else aren\u2019t you telling me?", "See what I mean?

I know.", "With style and class.", "I'm so feeling up Demi Moore.", "(as a ghost, sticking his hand in Sam) Am I making you uncomfortable?", "You're such a prude. Come on.", "Honestly, if I had a nickel for every time I heard a girl say that...", "How the hell are we supposed to fight that?", "By tonight? Yeah, sure.

But I just can`t keep pretending that everything's all right. Because it's not. And it's never going to be. You chose a demon over your own brother... and look what happened.", "I know you would. And I know how sorry you are, I do. But, man... you were the one that I depended on the most. And you let me down in ways that I can't even... I'm just- I'm having a hard time forgiving and forgetting here. You know?", "Honestly? Nothing. I just don't... I don't think that we can ever be what we were. You know? I just don't think I can trust you.", "What's it been, like three days now? We got to cheer [Bobby] up. Maybe I'll give him a back rub.", "Cell phone, Cas? Really?", "[quietly, to Sam] Well, at least he's talking now.", "Okay.", "Yeah, you wanna help?", "Oh, well, thanks for the support.", "God?", "God.", "Try New Mexico, I hear He's on a tortilla.", "Listen, chuckles, even if there is a God, He's either dead, and that's the generous theory-", "...or, He's up and kicking and doesn't give a rat's ass about any of us. I mean, look around you, man; the world is in the toilet! We are literally at the end of days here, and He's off somewhere drinking booze out of a coconut. Alright?", "It's a pipe-dream, Cas.", "Ow!", "Sorry, Ellen.", "Yes, ma'am", "So. Pit stop at Mount Doom?", "Sam, let\u2019s not.", "So what are you saying?", "Well I think you're right.", "The truth is, I spend more time worrying about you, than about doing the job right. I just can't afford that, you know? Not now.", "I know you are, Sam. Hey, you, uh... wanna take the Impala?", "Yeah, you too, Sammy.", "[hunting a vampire] Eat it, Twilight.", "[to Castiel] You were wasted by a Teenage Mutant Ninja Angel?

That's how you become president.", "Any idea what set them off?", "[at same time] Nothing.", "[at same time] Nothing. Demons, you know drink, adultery. We all have our demons Walt.", "[referring to Raphael's catatonic vessel] I take it that's not Raphael anymore.", "So is this what I'm lookin' at if Michael jumps my bones?", "Where've you been?", "Oh, how was it?", "Tell me something; you keep saying we're gonna trap this guy, but isn't that kinda like trapping a hurricane with a butterfly net?", "Do we have any chance of surviving this?", "...So, odds are, you're a dead man tomorrow?", "Oh. Well, last night on earth, what, uh... what're your plans?", "Dude, c'mon, anything? Hm? Booze, women?", "You have been with a woman before. Right? Or an angel, at least? You mean to tell me you've never been up there doing a little cloud seeding?", "Let me tell you something, there are two things I know for certain; one, Bert and Ernie are gay. Two, you are not gonna die a virgin. Not on my watch. Let's go.", "Hey. Relax!", "Dude, you full-on rebelled against heaven. Iniquity is one of the perks!", "Cas! His name is Cas. What's your name?", "Chastity?", "Wow. [to Castiel] Is that kismet or what, buddy? Huh?", "[gives Castiel cash for a stripper] Hey. Listen. Take this. If she asks for a credit card, no. Now just stick to the basics, okay? Do not order off the menu. Go get her, Tiger. [Castiel hesitates] Don't make me push you.", "[after Chastity storms away] What the hell did you do?", "[rolls his eyes, and laughs in disbelief] Oh, no, man!", "This whole industry runs on absent fathers, it's- it's the natural order.", "Oh, you know, I thought you were supposed to be impressive. All you do is black out the room?", "Or maybe you're full of crap. Maybe you're afraid that God'll bring Cas back to life again, and smite you and your candy-ass skirt. By the way, hi, I'm Dean. [Waves]", "Oh yeah? Well then who invented the Chinese basket trick?", "Yeah, who would be so proud to know that His sons started the friggin' apocalypse.", "So daddy ran away and disappeared. He didn't happen to work for the post office, did He?", "What he said.", "Look, I'll be the first to tell you that this little crusade of yours is nuts, but... I do know a little something about missing fathers.", "I mean, there were times when I was looking for my dad when... all logic said that he was dead. But I knew, in my heart, that he was still alive. So, who cares what some Ninja Turtle says, Cas? What do you believe?", "Good. Then go find Him.", "What about me? I don't know. Honestly... I'm good. I can't believe I'm saying that, but I am, I'm... I'm really good.", "Especially without my brother. I mean, I spend so much time worrying about the son of a bitch. I mean, I've had more fun with you in the past twenty-four hours than I've had with Sam in years. And you're not that much fun. It's funny, you know, I've been so chained to my family, but now that I'm alone... hell, I'm happy.", "[chuckles] You know, it's kinda funny; talking to a Messenger of God on a cellphone, it's... y'know, like watching a Hell's Angel ride a moped.", "Kansas City...

Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?", "Just when we thought you were out, they pull you back in, huh, Sammy?", "What are you looking for?", "I guess I'm a little numb with the earth-shattering revelations at this point.", "So what, you're just gonna walk back in, and we're gonna be the dynamic duo again?", "Look, Sam, it doesn't matter. Whatever we do. I mean, it turns out that you and me, we're the, uh... the fire and the oil of the Armageddon. You know, on that basis alone, we should just pick a hemisphere. Stay away from each other for good.", "Yeah, you're right, we can. But not together. We're not stronger when we're together, Sam. I think we're weaker. Because whatever we have between us; love, family, whatever it is; they are always gonna use it against us. And you know that. No, we're better off apart. We got a better chance of dodging Lucifer and Michael and this whole damn thing... if we just go our own ways.", "Goodbye, Sam.", "I'm you, from the tail end of 2009. Zach plucked my from my bed and... threw me 5 years into the future.", "I don't know.", "No. I don't know. Look I just wanna get back to my own freakin' year, okay?", "Rhonda Hurley. We were...uh, 19. She made us try on her panties. They were pink... and satin-y. And you know what? We kinda liked it.", "What are you, a hippie?", "Cas, we need to talk.", "What?", "No! Yeah- yes. Exactly.", "2009.", "Yes.", "Oh yeah, it's friggin' fascinating. Now... why don't you just strap on your angel wings and fly me back to my page on the calender?", "...What are you, stoned?", "What happened to you?", "\"Yes\"? ...Wait... you mean-", "[quietly] Why he would do that?", "Yeah, 'fraid so.", "Thank you, Chuck.", "So you're human? Well, welcome to the club.", "[to 2014-Dean] Hey, uh... me. Can I talk to you for a sec?", "Well go ahead. Kill me.", "I don't know, maybe deep-fry the planet?", "Oh, good God, you're not gonna tell me a bedtime story, are ya? My stomach's almost outta bile.", "[voice wavering] You're not fooling me, you know that? With this 'sympathy for the devil' crap. I know what you are.", "You're the same thing, only bigger. The same brand of cockroach I've been squashing my whole life. An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground supernatural piece of crap. The only difference between them and you, is the size of your ego.", "[voice harsh and hoarse] You better kill me now!", "You better kill me now! Or I swear, I will find a way to kill you. And I won't stop-", "[tears start falling freely]", "You're wrong.", "That's pretty nice timing, Cas.", "[grabs Castiel's shoulder] Don't ever change.", "Sam. [Holds Ruby's knife out to Sam] If you're serious, and you want back in... you should hang onto this. I'm sure you're rusty. Look, man, I'm sorry. I'm... whatever I need to be, but I was, uh... wrong.", "Long story. The point is... maybe we are each other's Achilles' heel. Maybe they'll find a way to use us against each other, I don't know. I just know, we're all we've got. More than that... we keep each other human.", "Oh, I know it. I mean, you are the second-best hunter on the planet", "We make our own future.", "Dude suffers a head-on collision in a parked car?

I needed a drink.", "So you're saying we've got two super-famous, super-pissed-off ghosts killing their... super-fans?", "Check it out. Four score and seven years ago... I had a funny hat.", "Let me get this straight: your, uh, ultimate hero was not only a short man in diapers, but he was also a fruitarian.", "That is good. That is-even for you, that is good.", "He was a ghost. He was a weirdly super-charged, fruitarian ghost, but it was still a ghost.", "Until I say so.", "Wow. just when I thought you couldn't get any geekier.", "Not a word.", "...

You know I'm starting to get why parents lie to their kids. You want them to believe that the worst thing out there is to mix some pop rocks and coke. Protect them from the real evil. You want them going to bed feeling safe. If that means lying to them, so be it. More I think about it... more I wish dad would've lied to us.", "So you were just gonna shoot some old guy, is that it?", "The old chick in Titanic. I know, shut up.", "[to Sam] Dude... I believe that he-witch gave you the clap.", "You're not useless, Bobby.", "Whoa, wait a moment, listen to me... you don't stop being a soldier 'cause you got wounded in battle. Okay? No matter what shape you're in, bottom line is: you're family. Now I don't know if you've noticed but me and Sam, we don't have much left. I can't do this without you. I can't.

Do you think he was telling the truth?", "So what do we do?", "I'll tell you one thing \u2013 right about now wish I was back in a TV show.", "Who gave you the rights to our life story?", "Well, you sure look lovely tonight. Especially for a dead chick.", "How so?", "What? They're freaking annoying.", "No, I am not a fan, okay. Not fans. In fact, I think the Dean and Sam story sucks. It is not fun, it's not entertaining. It is a river of crap that would send most people howling to the nuthouse! So you listen to me. Their pain is not for your amusement. I mean, do you think they enjoy being treated like-like circus freaks?", "Oh, they care. Believe me, they care a lot!", "[to Sam] Just give her the puppy dog thing, okay?", "That so?", "Going down? Right. Okay, Huggy Bear, just don't lose him.", "Oh, uh, excuse me for asking, but aren't you kind of signing your own death warrant?

None.", "I'm a demon.", "You call that mercy? Imagine you spend your whole life hunting down the guy that knifed your father.

That kid is going to spend his whole life knowing that he had his shot and that he couldn\u2019t beat me, that ain't mercy. That's the worst thing I could have done to him.

See from where I'm sitting there ain't much difference from what I turned into and what you already are.", "I know what you did when you went looking for me. And I know how far you went.

But I'm loving the new model -- lean, mean Dean.", "You notice I tried to get as far away from you possible? Away from your whining, your complaining. I chose the King of Hell over you. Maybe I was just... tired of babysitting you. Or always having to yank your lame ass out of the fire, since... forever.

The note. Crowley. Everything.", "Oh I was a demon, I didn't realize.", "Not to mention, I never said thank you. So...", "No. Tasha's in too deep. You don't ever come back from that. Not ever.", "Let's say you're right.", "Everything. Maybe I'm not ready to hunt. But I am just trying to do the right thing, man.

A friend of mine hooked me up with the unpublished-unpublished books. So Sam came back from Hell, but without his soul, and Cas brought in a bunch of Leviathans from Purgatory. They lost Bobby, and then Cas and Dean got stuck in Purgatory, Sam hit a dog. Uh, they met a prophet named Kevin, they lost him too. Then Sam underwent a series of trials, in an attempt to close the Gates of Hell, which nearly cost him his life.

Look man I got one of those too, okay but those stories that we tell that keep us going, sometimes they blind us. They take us to dark places, kinda place where I might beat the crap out of a good man, just for the fun of it. The people who love me, they pulled me back from that edge. Cole once you touch that darkness, it never goes away. Now the truth is, I'm past saving. I know how my story ends; it's at the edge of a blade or the barrel of a gun.

Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, \"You may take our pride, but you'll never take MY GODDAMNED SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND TWELVE CENTS!!!\" Now who's with me?!!", "[groans] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy.", "[begins to wolf down the food] God, this is really good, Scott!", "[through a mouthful of chili] What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]", "Yes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [a shot of Cartman talking to Denkins, who is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [a shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [the Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the \"starving\" pony. Seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them; they go down]", "I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [a shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could personally tell you about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behind Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [a gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, \"Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.\"", "[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are horrified]", "[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yeees! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.", "Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! Mm-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face] Mm-yummy, you guys! [fade out, then quickly back in to Looney Tunes-style iris] Be-de-be-de, that's all, folks!", "Look, if you don't come and do this show, I'll make you eat your parents!", "Kenny's a random slut!", "If you see anyone on my propertah, especially Stan or Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!", "What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me? All the wet, spit-filled kisses I put up with? The constant smell of aspirin and pee? Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch.", "I'm puttin' on a new condom. I filled the other one up.", "So I don't get AIDS.", "Yeah, you want us unprotected, you asshole?", "Just put it on, Butters.", "Butters, will you stop fuh-...filibustering?", "I wasn't looking at his schlong! I was seeing how to put the condom on!", "Do you feel protected?", "Here, talk to them, Butters.", "Towelie, you are the worst character ever.", "You just have no long-term memory because you get high all the time.", "I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!", "Oh yeah, well you're a towel!", "I told you, jawas have no heart.", "You know, sand people.", "Oh no, not Towelie.", "[talking fast] NO WE DON'T WANNA GET HIGH!", "That's right!", "Hey, what the hell are you talking about? I'm not a goddamn Canadian and neither are you.", "Okay, why?", "Maybe we should send him to a concentration camp. Oh! Dammit, dammit, dammit!", "[on the phone] Oh, please! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for 70 cents on the dollar. You tell me, Chuck... Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck: I wasn't born yesterday either!", "I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake. [laughs]", "I can't lose weight, Butters, because I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!", "Dammit Butters! Keep eating, or else I'll kick your ass till you're deader than Kenny!", "How long do we have to wait before we can joke about it?", "Damn, that's a long time to wait.", "[impersonating Butters] Oh, gee whiz, I'm not watchin' television, Dad. I'm just layin' around jackin it.", "[impersonating Butters] Well, my hot, spicy boner, of course, Dad.", "[impersonating Butters] Aw, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.", "[impersonating Butters] Bring it on, queer-bait.", "[impersonating Butters] Yeah, well, uh, Dad's bein' a little pussy, Mom.", "[impersonating Butters] Uh, not from you dumb-asses, that's for sure.", "[impersonating Butters] I'll be waiting with bells on, you-you old horse-bangin' skank.", "Then eat your puke!", "C'mon, Japanese girls do it!", "[outside; listening] Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.", "Hey you guys, Butters is asleep.", "Have you seen this trick? When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, and when you put their hand in it...", "...and then you pee on them!", "Oh really? Oh well.", "Oh yeah? I run with 12 gangs, and we only commit hate crimes. Whatevah--I do what I want!", "Whatevah, I'll crap in Maury's pants!", "I was once involved in a drive-by shooting! Whatevah, I do what I want!", "I'm so bad I ran for Congress and won! Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, then hid her body! Whatevah, I do what I want!", "I'm so bad I digitally put Jabba the Hut back in the original Star Wars movie! Whatevah, I do what I want!", "[in his sleep] No, Uncle Jesse, no!", "Where're we going?", "What? Why?", "So...", "Well, let's see. In the last 3.2 seconds you've called me fatass, butthole and douchebag. I don't feel like you guys are friends.", "Aha, aha! You do need me and my Mission Impossible playset!", "Okay, I'll go, if Kyle will kiss my black ass. [lowers pants to show his butt]", "Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.", "Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it.", "Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.", "No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman farts in his face]", "[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!", "Hell, I'm not goin' with you!", "[to a baby cow] Go ahead, that's more for us. You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? Who's the hungry man?", "We'll give you one calf, if you give us...some guns and ammunition of our own!", "Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.", "Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.", "Mike.", "We got a sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things?", "Oh Mike, you're breaking my balls!", "What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!", "Ugh! Some goddamned Klingon you are!", "Butters will give handjobs in the corner for a dollar.", "[glares at Butters] Oh, goddammit, you better be kidding!", "I'm afraid we gonna have to let you go...as our friend. You're just too...", "Lame, yes.", "You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!", "Oh, shut up, Kyle! Shut your goddamn Jew mouth! You people are why there's war in the Middle East! And you, Tweek, why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her! God, I hate you guys!", "[explaining where he obtained the \"sea men\" for his aquarium] Yeah, I bought all I could from this bank...I got the rest from this guy named Ralph in an alley--stupid asshole didn't even charge me, he just told me to close my eyes and suck it out of a hose!", "Suck it out of a hose, yeah.", "Yeah, a hippie and a terrorist is the same thing.", "Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek turns on stereo that starts playing Carribbean music; Cartman start singing] In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of--", "No, he has an icy heart.", "But it's a cool island song.", "Oh, do we wanna do that?", "Wow!", "Ey!", "[the boys are discussing who to kick out of their group] So Kyle, I want to tell you it's been very fun and we're gonna miss you. [pulls out two containers] Here's a nice watch and some peanuts.", "And it's sad to see you go. Maybe you can make friends with the kids down the road. Three cheers for Kyle! Hip hip...", "[whining] Pleeeeease?", "All right, then I guess we have no choice-- [turns to Tweek] but to let you go, Tweek, I want to say you've been great filling in as a fourth friend and we're gonna miss you. [moves the watch and peanuts to Tweek's side] Here's a watch and some peanuts.", "Well, dumb-asses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe?", "[furiously] Oh, that's fine! That's fine! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [walks away, then comes back] Fuck you, Tweek! [walks away, then comes back again] Bebe, you're still cool. [walks off, seething]", "[just as awkwardly] At least I'm not a stupid Jew.", "I don't know! It's like my brain just keeps...jacking off.", "You think?!", "[singing] In the ghetto, in the ghettoHe's a boy wearing orange who's losing his pride'Cause Kenny and his whole family resideIn the ghetto, in the ghetto", "What did you say?", "What did you say?!", "I said, shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina! [comes to] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?", "Maybe, we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.", "I've never heard the words \"only\" and \"candy\" in the same sentence before.", "Ha! Fags!", "Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!", "[whispering to Craig] Yo, I think that Mr. Slave guy's a...Pakistani.", "No, it was Kenny!", "I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.", "I'll take three lunches today, please.", "It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC.", "Tolerance kicks ass!", "Hey, guys! How's it goin'?", "What the hell are you assholes doing here?", "[laughing] That was Kenny laughing, not me.", "Oh, wow, really? That's so awesome. Now I'll really work to be successful!", "Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doing drugs when I want!

Unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle bat so this may take a while. [hits him again]", "Okay, last night all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30 at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy the goth chick from The Breakfast Club who was bowling in the lane next to us when we asked her for her autograph but she didn't have a pen so we followed her out to her car but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45 at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Ranchas des Fritas Rojes South of Castle Rock and finally got a ride home from a man who was missing his left index finger named Gary Bushwell arriving home at 11:46.", "Yeah, go home, you little dildo!", "Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dick head.", "Dude....

You're going to take that butthole? Why?", "I have never been a dick to you!", "Kyle, when is the last time I rip on you for being a Jew?

Knock knock!", "Hey, Kyle.", "I'm not Kyle. I already know you told Butters he can go.", "So fine, Kyle, but honestly I never meant to treat you as you don't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap but we also have been through a lot together. Maybe that alone doesn't makes us friends but it makes us something. So fine, Kyle, I hope things will be cool.", "I know, Kyle. I'll see you later.", "I care sure but I hope it doesn't mean you, me, Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.", "Sure.", "Sweet whatever!

I keep it next to my gun.", "What is it, if you don't mind?", "And Cortexiphan?", "Walter, the last time you used that thing, you drilled it into the guy's head.", "How is everything?", "Walter, have you got any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this?", "Is that....", "Peter, what is happening to me?", "Learn to like new things.", "Ah, no sir. Walter said the teeth marks are definitely human.", "[to her sister] Now this is just one of those things that you're gonna look back on and you're gonna say 'I beat that too.'", "What process?", "Super-soldiers.", "What war?", "What did Jones want from you? What did he do to you in the elevator?", "What can he do with it?", "What are you doing here?", "Where am I? Who are you?", "So who was she?", "She thought I knew where something was hidden.", "Sure.", "No. Latin?", "There really is no point where things can't get weirder, is there? What does it mean?", "Nope. Anything I've forgotten, they can keep. I don't want to spend another minute here. I'm, uh, no good at sitting around.", "[smiling] Oh, I'll let you carry my suitcase.", "Maybe I should wait outside.", "[to Sam Weiss] Cut the Yoda crap and tell me what's happening to me.", "Walter? Have you made any headway?", "Walter, I know you're worried, we all are, but we can get Peter back. We just need you to find a way to disable Tyler.", "He helps me, too, but you can do this.", "Did you eat?", "Well, that's unfortunate.", "I didn't know you spoke Cantonese.", "What?", "You know, all my life I've been able to understand what drives people: their emotions, like greed, or envy, revenge, but Newton? These people we're up against? How can I fight what I don't understand?", "I don't mean to sound callous, but from what I know of your father, going crazy made him a better person. It certainly made him a better father.", "I think you're making up for that now.", "I ran into a guy from high school this morning. You should have seen the look in his eyes when I told him what I did.", "More like I was a freak. Like I had suddenly grown a third eye. Ever get the feeling that doing this job makes you less and less normal?", "[to Peter] You had no choice. The first time I killed someone, the guy was a trained killer. If I hadn't pulled the trigger, I would be dead. I still didn't sleep that night, or the next. I'm just saying the first time is rough.", "No. I didn't try. She just went through all this stuff with me in the hospital, and she's still having nightmares about me being dead. What's the point of scaring her again? We are going to get out of this.", "Peter, they're going to shoot you.", "Uhh!", "Uhh! (diving for her dropped pistol below a vehicle)", "(in pain) Agh!", "You weren't yourself.", "Congratulations, Mr. Bishop. You've just won an all expense paid trip to New York City.", "Not according to our records. [smiles] It says here that you're a fan of fine dining and excitement!", "Did I mention there's excitement?", "I have a freakishly good memory. I remember everything. Not this. There's just nothing that's familiar.", "And how do we do that?", "[walks away and finds the room she was frightened in as a child, then sits in the corner]", "No. I'm not afraid of anything anymore.", "So you think we should just let the building disappear. Let those people disappear.", "Peter, I'm scared.", "Peter, I'm scared! [runs out of the room, up to the roof to find the shimmering building]", "I don't think that he can. I mean, not without you. Peter... you don't belong here.", "Yes, you do. I have thought of one hundred reasons... why you should come back. To -- to fight the shape-shifters, to take care of Walter, to -- to save the world. But in the end... you have to come back. Because you belong with me.", "You're not real.", "You can't prove anything!", "You're in my head.", "Like what?", "See, now you're lying, because we hate Chicago --", "There's no way to prove it.", "Don't apologize. You were the only thing that got me through. If it wasn't for you I would never had made it back. You saved my life.", "You know what Barrett said? He said that he looked in her eyes and he knew it wasn't her.", "I understand the facts. I know that she had rims of information about me; about my life and about people who were close to me. And I understand if she stepped off, she would have a perfectly reasonable explanation for it. And I guess to expect you to have seen past that, perhaps is asking a little too much. When I was there, I thought about you. I knew you were just a figment of my imagination. I held on to you. It wasn't reasonable and it wasn't logical, but I did it. So, why didn't you? She wasn\u2019t me. How could you not see that? Now she\u2019s everywhere. She\u2019s in my house, my job, my bed, and I don\u2019t want to wear my clothes anymore, and I don\u2019t want to live in my apartment, and I don\u2019t want to be with you. She\u2019s taken everything.", "You don't have to.", "You know, I feel like Rip Van Winkle. Everything is different. Even you opening up to me is different. And this book is just a reminder of all the things that I have missed, conversations we didn't have...", "So why is this book your favorite book?", "It's bigger than I imagined.", "It just makes me wonder if he feels the same way. And, I would understand if he did. I was her for a while, and she's like me, only better.", "No, I mean, she still has her mother, and she wasn't experimented on as a child, and she can laugh, she has real friends, she even wears a dress every once in a while.", "The three of us?", "Peter, she's the one who took it away from us, not me.", "Do you really think this is the end of the world as we know it?", "Maybe I'm just incapable of being vulnerable.", "I'm terrified. That this is just who I am.", "Okay, I got one. You know when we're watching TV and you start to rub my back and you're not really paying attention because you're kind of distracted...", "And you, uh, turn your hand in a circle just over and over and over....", "It's kind of like you're burrowing through the muscle right into the bone.", "Okay. I don't like it.", "See? I love this full disclosure. Why didn't we make this agreement earlier?", "It's 6:30 in the morning.", "And, uh, your father is walking around the house naked.", "Is that safe?", "[whispers] I could get used to this. This is my favorite time of day: sunrise. The world is full of promise.", "Walter, what if I can't do it? What if I can't turn it off?", "No. You?", "Peter, I love you.", "Okay, Sam, I'm going to make this easy. I am armed, and I want you to take me to the key NOW.", "I understand how you feel.", "I can assure you that this case will take top --", "I'm not at liberty to discuss it.", "There is no one else. There is just me.", "That depends on your definition of all right. He's functional, except when he's not. But he's often quite brilliant. Just never had anything to tether him to the world.", "We can't do that.", "Because we can't disclose how they were killed. The families are informed that they have gone missing and we will continue to look for them --", "Look, I'm sorry, but --", "What you said before. I know what it's like to have a hole in my life. It's been there as long as I can remember. I told you about the incident on the plane? After that Broyles asked us to join Fringe Division, and somehow I knew that this is where I would find --", "My answers.", "Yes. It's also true.", "My stepfather? I killed him.", "He knows what she taught him, but he can't remember who she is. How is that possible?", "Why me and why now?", "[bandaging Walter's hand] I'm sorry. Does that hurt?", "It's curious, don't you think? The things that we see, that we investigate, and you don't bat an eye. Some harmless germs make you shake in your boots.", "Walter, I don't think I'm going to get much sleep tonight, either. What do you say to a rootbeer float?", "Walter, do you think we destroyed it? Do you think it's gone?", "I guess I did.", "Yeah.", "After our mother died my sister and I were due to go into the foster system. Instead, Nina pulled some strings and we went to live with her.", "Something like that.", "[smiles as Peter strokes her face as she lies on the grass, eyes closed] I thought I'd gotten rid of you.", "Where'd you disappear to?", "You know what this is.", "Yes. The perfect day.", "It's you, Peter. You are the problem.", "[Alarmed, having suddenly noticed an Observer, draws her gun and begins speaking simultaneously with September. ] Who are you? Show me your hands! How did you -- stop doing that! Who the hell are you?", "How did you know my name? How do you know my -- [notices a chest wound] You've been shot.", "I love you. Do you love me?", "Tell me. I want to hear you say it.", "What's she like?", "[smiles] The other Olivia. I'm just curious.", "I didn't picture you as the scamming type.", "Well, you've got good taste.", "Hey. [smiles] Um, this might be a little weird, but I was wondering if I could just come in and have a look around.", "[looks toward the couch] That's where Walter used to sleep.", "[turns to look at him] We had that case, that couple in apartment 6B, the woman who lost her husband. After I came back here and then we went upstairs. I remember.", "Peter, I remember William Bell. I remember crossing over to bring you back. I remember Jacksonville and seeing you shimmer the first time we kissed. I remember you walking to the machine and getting inside and being scared that you were going to die.", "I remember. I remember us. I remember everything.", "Look, in case you were wondering, it's hard for me too, you know. I keep expecting to see that look in your eye and it isn't there, or it is and you're pulling back.", "I'm confused, too. I feel incredibly close to you. I feel like I know you better than anyone else in the world, and when you look at me it's like none of that is true.", "I want you to behave naturally. I want you to treat me like you know me better than anyone in the world too, because you do.", "The last time I opened one of these it was rigged with Semtex.", "Yeah.", "Because when we were trying to figure out what happened to him we traced it back to a munitions trader in Hong Kong. Why?", "Okay.", "I don't understand it, either, but whatever this is, whatever the cause, I told you I'm not scared. I like the feeling.", "Now that the case is over, we would go back to one of each other's houses. I know that's what we would do. That was one of the things we would do. I know that. So now I don't know if I'm just supposed to ignore that for what you want, and I guess I just -- Peter, how do you want to play this? You don't have to answer now, I just want you to think --", "No, that's okay. I'm feeling better now. I guess all the energy that I expended did a number on my nervous system.", "Walter isn't always right.", "This isn't what happened --", "Peter, I don't understand what's happening to me anymore than you do, but that doesn't change what I do know, what you know, that if you look at me, if you look into my eyes, then you can see that I am her.", "Okay, Peter, I'm in love with you and I can't just turn that off now. I don't want to lose you. Where are you going?", "I'm in love with Peter. I know it sounds absurd, and to you I hardly know him, but it's like I've known him my entire life and everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.", "But I can remember things Peter couldn't have known, like details or cases he wasn't on or names, places that he's never been. I mean, how can that be if he's controlling it? I don't know how this is happening, but I'm scared.", "I just wish that time would move quicker.", "It's so good to be with you. We should do this more often. [notices Nina's alarm] What's wrong?", "I'm okay. I talked to Walter.", "Well, it doesn't matter. I met a woman today. She just lost her husband and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she wasn't in love. As I was listening to her, I realized what she was saying: she had let go of he possibility of love, of finding love, and I could see myself in her. I didn't like who I was. All of these memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a better version of me. I just decided to let things run their course.", "I've made my decision.", "Yes.", "I don't know. Neither does Walter.", "When the day comes, if I don't remember this, I want you to try and build something with me again. Don't give up on me. [Nina nods tearfully] I love you, Nina.", "Olivia. [motions toward Peter] Sorry, taken.", "Okay, here's a good one. According to Mayan prophecies, a serpent rope will appear in the center of the Milky Way.", "I didn't know that.", "That's funny, I was about to say the same thing about you. Keep looking up after it rains. Keep looking up.", "No.", "Um, only if I am being punished.", "Only if I'm dead.", "I thought you were allergic.", "Nursery?", "Nursery.", "Walter, do you have any idea what just happened to me?", "But how did I do it?", "I was thinking about that girl Jessica. One encounter with us and her child almost becomes an orphan. We deal with this every day. We're playing odds, Peter. What do you really think our chances are of having a normal life?", "I don't know what's happening to me, what I'm becoming. I've got this power inside me that terrifies me because I don't understand it, and I just want it out.", "Is that a personal guarantee?", "Yes. One square mile from the center of the beam.", "Oh no what?", "At least now we know how you got shot. I've seen you shot before just like this. You came to me at the opera house. You said in every version of the future I would have to die.", "She took a chance at dying in that office building for whatever her mission is. She was counting on me to save her. They used Jessica to play on my sympathies, and then they used my feelings for Peter; my fear that Jones would kill him.", "Why is he activating me now? Why is he doing this?", "You know, for the first time, I don't think that it is. I remember being in that lab in Jacksonville with Walter and William and doing the Cortexiphan trials. I remember how it smelled, how I felt, how scared I was, how all alone I was, and now years later nothing's changed. I'm still that little girl and William Bell is still doing experiments on me. I'm still being used.", "Peter --", "It's perfect.", "Actually, he did.", "Peter, I'm pregnant.", "Walter, is this what I think it is?", "Where did you get that?", "How long have you been wearing it?", "No, no. I want you to keep it. Let me see it. [smiles] You know, your father used to call this the bullet that saved the world.", "Look at me. You're going to be okay.", "We have to move you. Okay?", "Etta, I love you so much.", "What have you done?", "Simone, you have a gift. You can see things that other people can't. I don't doubt that. But wherever you think this gift came from, or whoever you think bestowed it upon you, it's simply an anomaly. I know that because I'm an anomaly. I have moved things with my mind. I've lit things on fire. I've caught bullets midair. I've seen things that people only dream about. I've seen... the seams between universes ripped apart. Things that humans shouldn't see. People make up explanations, assign meanings to things without knowing, because it's reassuring, comforting. But I can't do that. Because I know too much. It's all just numbers. And the invaders, as you call them\u2014\u2014 they're just better at math than we are.", "Nope.", "Etta's not gone, Peter. Windmark didn't take her.", "No, he didn't. She's still here with us.", "She saved my life today with the bullet she brought to us. She's alive inside us. And there's nothing that Windmark can do about it, because the love that we can share with her now is invulnerable to space and time, even to them. And I know that our hearts are broken and that it hurts, but that's what makes us human.", "No, Peter, it's our strength, because it's the one thing that they don't have. Now, we need to hold on to our connection with Etta, feeling what we felt for her, or she dies all over again. And we cannot let her be erased. Peter\u2014 Peter, I'm not asking you to abandon her. I'm asking you to hold on to her. You're not one of them, you're one of us.", "You okay?", "How are you feeling?", "Can I get you something?", "I'm not the maid.", "That choice was made for me a long time ago.", "Y-you\u2014 you killed a police officer?", "You son of a bitch.", "Is that it?", "Do you have any idea what you've done to me?", "Might be construed?", "I don't see that anything's changed. You're still coming with me.", "You'll want to come with me because I can take you to the one man who knows how the Miracle began.", "Angelo. Angelo Colasanto. He's waiting for you, Jack. He's been waiting for such a very long time.", "He talked about you all the time, Jack. His immortal man in old New York. He never forgot.", "You inspired him. You proved immortality was possible.

So what am I thinking right now?", "No. Well, actually, yes, but not for the reason you think.", "Never you mind.", "What if we take this case and it turns out she's guilty?", "How do you know?", "Why not?", "Suppose she did.", "Jane, I know I said I wouldn't ask, but I'm asking. Who is this woman? What's the connection?", "It's not on your record.", "Thank you for being so honest with me.", "Seriously, I've stuck my stupid neck out for you for the umpteenth time. I think I deserve the truth. Why is Sophie Miller so important to you?", "She's a psychiatrist.", "But you hate psychiatrists.

They're playing the Knicks tomorrow night.", "Everybody knows about that. The attorney general knows that.", "Just follow procedure. Have fun!", "What's your normal procedure?", "So you've got it down to a science?", "Okay, Mr. Fricke, and what is it that you do?", "A pickup artist? That's your profession?", "You know damn well what. You assaulted a man.", "Technically, that's assault.", "Like we're toasters?", "Which should be a criminal offense but it isn't.", "Do you keep a list of your pick-ups?", "Nice.

You can't see.", "Guess what, he's a bad patient.", "I know. I can read your mind.", "You're thinking Mr. Skelling is innocent and we should release him. [Calls out to Cho] Cho.", "No. I think you want him to be innocent because his guilt would be too simple.

[Looks under the bed] No, I don't think there's a pressure trigger. You can get up now.", "I'm sure it doesn't. Timer's set to go off in 10 minutes, so we have plenty of time.

Cute.", "Carl is still our prime suspect in this. We can't use him a bait.", "This case is closed. You're just seeing suggestion everywhere, Jane. You're too suggestible.", "Oh, right. Too much of a control freak for that?", "Okay, he's hypnotized.", "Hypnotism is what you use against my explicit orders to get witnesses to tell the truth.

The truth.", "Since I said so.", "You're off the unit.", "Oh, really? So we're lost without you, are we?", "Let's go!", "You're leaving?", "You're right. Best you leave. That way you can go back to being a full-time fraud and we can continue our useless jobs in peace.", "I thought you were quitting.", "So the job is worthwhile, is it?", "No jokes.

You mean say thank you?", "The thing is, not dealing with you every day has been very restful for me. My back pain is gone. I sleep really well.

Jazz guitarist.", "I looked at his fingers. Guitarist fingers. Jazz with a flamenco edge, judging by the ridge on his thumb.", "If we're lucky, we'll find a murder weapon. It was obviously a well-planned robbery.", "Nobody finds themselves in a locked room full of old masters in the middle of the night by accident, do they? So, well-planned.", "You call her.", "Oh, come on, guys. I just robbed a Russian mobster. You can't call Lisbon?", "Where is the fun in that?", "You and Miss Duane came up here to have sex in the boss's office.", "Because it's forbidden and thus very sexy, of course, especially if you have father issues. And who doesn't? It's furtive but powerful challenge to the paternal authority.", "What?", "I just tweaked him on the nose.", "Technically, he's an ass. He deserved it.", "[observing Cho] Kid's a natural. Look at him. The Cho. No business like Cho business.", "Can't sleep alone, huh?", "There's something on this side of the room you don't want us to find. What is that?", "Look me in the eye and say that.", "Nah. Too much stuff. Not very tidy. Good in bed, I expect, yeah? Messy women make good lovers.", "All you need is a basic understanding of the evolutionary psychology of women. Rigorously and fearlessly applied. You get to know what buttons to press.", "Men are like toasters. Women...little more like accordions.", "[He looks Fricke straight in the eyes] Do you know who killed Claire?", "Interesting. He is either a habitual liar telling the truth, or he's an honest man lying.", "I do hate when people say thank you.", "Exactly.", "Well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman.", "No.", "This blind thing really works. Without my vision, I can tune into my other senses much more clearly.", "I wanna know what your face feels like when you\u2019re smiling.", "I\u2019m still convinced there\u2019s a connection between Medina and me, so before you make me that superhero costume I\u2019m looking forward to, could you take me to visit with his widow?", "Thank you. And incidentally, you\u2019re smelling particularly good today. [Lisbon rolls her eyes and walks away] Is that cinnamon in the mix there somewhere? Lisbon? [He reaches out to see if she\u2019s still there]", "But first, could someone please make me a cup of tea?", "Is that a yes? [Sniffs a few times] Rigsby.", "Gullible women.", "Thanks, Virgil.", "I hope he's smiling.", "Holding something of James' would help me pick up a feel for him. Get a sense of his being.", "Thank you.", "Just go with it. I have to practice this touchy-feely stuff. It's been a while.", "No, right. Because bad stuff like this doesn't happen nearly as often as people think it does.", "Ha, humor. Great. Everybody loves a witty doctor in times of trouble.", "Not on my phone it isn't.", "The text read, \"Are you smart enough to find it?\" I think this was directed at me.", "Didn't catch his name.", "No.", "They've had enough of me. Officer Powell here was kind enough to give me a ride back.", "The score?", "Ask her yourself.", "What are you, a man or a mouse?", "Could've fooled me.", "Well, that would be a strong, romantic statement. Women like a man that would kill for them. Hey, Van Pelt!", "Grace, personal question. Rigsby and I were wondering, uh...who is this man you were kissing by the coffee cart?", "Not from payroll?", "Well, thank heavens for that, at least. No killing needed.", "You'll see. Honesty's best.", "Oh, doctor's orders. She said it was the best thing for me to do, get back to work.", "Nah. So?", "What was I supposed to do, just sit there and listen to television? Besides, the food was terrible.", "I need to work.", "It's no problem, honestly. My other senses are heightened. They're super heightened. I'm like Daredevil. Now, if you'll excuse me.", "Ah, heightened.", "Oh, please don't look at each other like that.", "I can feel. I can feel your pity.", "I'm not a bad patient. She's a bad visitor.", "You're very confident of his innocence. How can you be so sure?", "You suspected he might indeed have done it. But he denied it. You believe him.", "Wives often say that about their husbands. Easy to fool yourself that the people you love are honest.", "Oh, you can?", "That's amazing. That's exactly what I was thinking. How do you do that? Let me try. You're thinking, Jane is right, the man is innocent, we should let him go.", "Yeah.", "I doubt it. Skelling's in his element up there. His survivalist fantasy come true. He's gone aground like a grizzly bear.", "Boom!", "Sorry, I couldn't resist.", "Meh. Legal proof will be found, no doubt, but personally I don't need it. I just like to know that I'm right.", "Talk to me.", "No, I can just fall asleep and we can drift into oncoming traffic. Your call.", "No. You?", "Interesting.", "Nothing. It's a little disappointing.", "Nice drive though.", "We should talk to the Carnelian executives again. Throw a cat among the pigeons.", "What if this is not what it looks like it's about. What if it's something else entirely.", "I don't know.", "Yeah.", "Jessie, if your husband is innocent then we're your best friends. We'll prove he's innocent. Will you help us?", "David wouldn't want you to respectfully acknowledge his tragic and untimely death? Oh, well, okay. He wouldn't want it to interfere with your kayaking schedule.", "Wait. I think we should wait.", "I have no idea, but it's a pleasant spot, and I have sandwiches.", "Where is it?", "Interesting.", "Desert's beautiful this time of year. Let's all go. We can bring a picnic lunch.", "Hooray. I was about to go mad with boredom.", "Well, if they have, my happiness makes no difference to them.", "True, but it makes a difference to the killer.", "Look what I found.", "It's a worm, fossilized worm.", "You know, when this worm was alive, this whole desert was the floor of a great sea. There were dinosaurs swimming above us.", "Yeah.", "Sharks the size of buses, brilliantly colored sea monsters. Those mountains, they would have been volcanoes.", "Really, you don't trust me?", "Well, we have to remedy this. Let's do a trust fall.", "Yeah. I'm sure you did one on your CBI retreat. It's when you turn around and fall backward, and I catch you.", "Mm-hmmm.", "You won't?", "Ah. Here we have two co-workers recognizing the boundaries of their professional relationship. See, you want to trust me, but there's something holding you back.", "Lisbon, I want you to know that you can trust me. No matter what happens, I will be there for you. I will. I need you to know that.", "Oh. A picnic lunch.", "A bomb.", "Seriously. A bomb.", "Is he?", "It's not lying if he believes it.", "If we walk, you can burn some case-closed pizza calories.", "You wanna be like Tina Turner?", "Well, as long as we don't lose him or break him, then what's the problem?", "Hmm.", "Deeply hypnotized subjects are very suggestible and have very little inhibition. Rigsby, do me a favor. Close your eyes. Please. [Rigsby closes his eyes] Now, relax. Don't tell me, but think about it. Think about what you most wanna be doing right now. You can do anything you like in the whole world. What are you gonna do? I want you to open your eyes and do it.", "Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.", "Hypnosis is just a way to connect to the imagination rather than the conscious mind. The mind will accept whatever the imagination creates, however bizarre.", "Different in scale.", "He's all soft and squishy and malleable.", "I could try but without knowing the trigger it would be like you and me playing Marco Polo in the Atlantic. Take forever and you get all pruny. Easier just to find the hypnotist and ask him.", "Well, sneaky ways to influence people doesn't sound quite as catchy.", "Coward.", "You honestly don't remember it?", "It'll come to you.", "That's true.", "You know what I predict?", "Guess.", "No, I think you should guess, it's good for you. (Lisbon gives him a look.) I predict that Brandon Fulton will pay a visit to the Hanson residence this evening.", "Love is not blind, but it's often pretty stupid.", "Whoo. She was some woman. Make the mighty agent Lisbon blush like a school girl.", "Oh, Mitch, I thought we'd worked through your doormat issues. [To Lisbon] Tell Cho to squeeze him a little, he knows things.", "Sure you do, Mitch.", "What is it that first attracted you to your husband? Not his looks.", "Yeah, really. He's not your type.", "Oh, ah, sporty bad boys with a hidden masochistic streak.", "Not too bright.", "No, that was a bull's eye.", "Oh, he's lying. They had an argument. You go out to celebrate with the man that financed your movie and only pay half the dinner bill?", "You'll never take me alive, copper.", "Seriously, it's Marilyn and Charlie. What, do you want to make a comedy arrest, see your name written in the weird news section?", "Yeah, you guys go find out. I'll find the couch. [Stands up and turns around] Oh, there it is.", "I'm not saying you knew about the affair, I'm just saying that if you did, you'd be our prime suspect. Funny when your best defense is your apparent lack of the most basic detective skills.", "I'm sorry. I'm just thinking aloud. No offense.", "None taken.", "Palm Desert right here in California?", "Palm Desert's not in California?", "Oh, I thought you meant Palm Desert wasn't in California. It is in California, right?", "Thanks for your time, Mr. Battaglia. See you later.", "I'm finished talking with you.", "I do when there's witnesses around.", "You think you have a certain charm about you, and you do, but you live by oppression. In reality you're just a greedy, twisted little sadist.", "She's scared. She's of Italian descent. She bites her nails. She doesn't like pets or pineapple.", "Even for a midget villain like yourself, that's an untenable position. Every modern society has some kind of police force. It's like saying, screw the public transport system.", "You need some love in your heart.", "Yeah, it is.", "And why should we trust you?", "What do I know?", "Oh, it's a figure of speech.", "So we shouldn't trust you, really.", "Cho. [Cho hands Lisbon a present and Jane covers his eyes]", "I got it.", "It's a mid- to high- end bottle of... wine-- aah, no, no, no. Champagne.", "Yup, there I go. [whispering to Cho] Re-gift?", "Do I detect a slight residue of grumpiness in you demeanor?", "I swear to you, Lisbon, your gift is on its way.", "[To Rigsby] She's still grumpy with me, isn't she?", "Oh, it's on its way. [Rigsby laughs]", "You really think that I would forget your birthday present? [Lisbon nods] It's on its way.", "Little grumpy because daddy didn't buy you a pony?", "Look at it this way. We've closed yet another case.", "Meh. You just trying to find fault. And I know why.", "You're still a little grumpy about the birthday present thing.", "Unbelievable. You've got no reason to be grumpy anymore. [He puts a red bow on Lisbon's office door. She opens the door and finds a pony standing in her office. Lisbon smiles and is lost for words]", "Oh, and thank you.", "For just letting us play it out like this.", "My friend Cho here will now take you by the wrist so as not to let you escape us again.", "I bet you say that to all your arresting officers.", "Hello, gorgeous.", "I'd call you by your real name, but I don't know what it is.", "Hi.", "Oh, for finding you? Wasn't that difficult.", "Thank you, no. I hear they're not so good for your health.", "It'd be horrible, wouldn't it? Immortality. Imagine the boredom.", "Yes, this is also the key to a locker that holds ten million dollars.", "Nope. Ten million dollars.", "[To Cho] She's good.", "Well, let's make a deal. I'll tell you how we found you if you tell us who you are.", "I planted a GPS tracking device on you. Outstanding technology. No bigger than a stick of gum.", "And I didn't plant a GPS tracking device on you.", "Whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair I check the bottoms of their shoes. The bottoms of your shoes were scuffed. I've been checking shoes for years. This is the first time it's ever paid off. First time. That's gratifying, man. Very, very gratifying.", "Uh, I don't know about that, agent Hayes. She's very good at what she does.", "That urge you have to get one over on people, the need to be smarter than the next guy? It'll keep biting you on the ass.", "You'd look good with short hair. Choppy, all kind of Peter Pan. Good for the eyes.", "What's wrong with a train station?", "Make much money, playing the keyboards?", "Yeah, it is. So is money. Everything that exists has a spiritual essence. Or not at all.", "When was the last time you saw a doctor's handwriting you could read?", "Yes, and the possibility that Dr. Brooke Harper is not a doctor.", "And she doesn't have that cold, creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have.", "First day in Medical School they get a stack of books and a dead human being. That, I'm afraid, would change you. Brooke Harper was warm and emotional.", "Pretty much.", "Yes, I did. The story of the mad axeman Zachariah, who lives in these here woods.", "Yes, Z. I would have gotten more, but you came back too quickly.", "Well, it's an actual fact that you dislike Mr. MacLean here because he's a tree-hugging, liberal wacko who's probably running some kind of a cult. And he dislikes you because you're a small-minded, provincial hayseed. Not that you are necessarily. That's just what he thinks.", "Oh, that sounds horribly tedious. Shout if you need me.", "Who's Zachariah?", "Zachariah?", "Liar.", "Pants on fire. They're ablaze.", "Excuse me, what kind of tree is this?", "Smells good. So you're not a local?", "Respect for...?", "Yes, yes, he's dead. He doesn't care how I talk to you.", "Statistically, it's dad that did it.", "Just wanted to raise his pulse a little.", "Do you always follow your husband's lead? Do you never struggle against his desire to control?", "Just because you drink too much doesn't mean you don't have a say. I should think he's at least half the reason you drink in the first place. Yeah? A good man, but cold, pious.", "Please understand something. I have a very personal interest in this case. I'll do whatever it takes. I will have you framed for murder. I will torture you, I will kill you myself if I have to.", "If we catch Red John, he's not walking anywhere. He's mine.", "Crazy? You're crazy if you think you're gonna stop me. Red John is mine. You try to stand in my way and you will regret it.", "No, I'm just saying that if you stand in my way you--", "Oh, you think so? You should have waited. We agreed on that.", "He would have led you straight to Red John.", "But you would have Red John.", "Well, you think wrong.", "I wish that I could, but, you know, some things you just can't fix.", "What do you know about the case?", "Well... [He leaves the room]", "Candice, take my advice. Forgive your mother. Maybe the headaches will stop.", "Oh, I'm wrong. Ignore my advice.", "Well, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not happy I'm off the Red John case. You might be right. Here's the thing Sam, if I may. I know this case. I can be a very good resource for you if we could just come to some kind of understanding.", "Yeah... sure.", "Yeah, let's just keep an open line of communication.", "[laughs]", "I understand you. It may take you some time to understand me.", "You read the interviews in my case file. You can read. Very impressive.", "AHA! Of course.", "Rigsby, you're right. You shouldn't be here. Let us take this. You go find the nearest library.", "Your punishment for being a wuss is I'm not gonna tell you.", "Nope, I'm not gonna tell you.", "You're glad Bosco has the Red John case, aren't you?", "Is that what your shrink tells you?", "But your shrink did tell you that, didn't he?", "No one in particular.", "Oh. No, me too. You want no fuss, no mess, right? I am casting a wide, invisible net, the killer won't even know he's in it until it's too late.", "Yes, he is.", "Since when is that the rule?", "Or else what?", "That's not leverage. This is my last case, remember. The only reason I'm still here is because I'm worried about how you guys would cope without me.", "Well, yeah. Let's be honest here.", "Well, frankly if I can't use this job to seek some kind of personal revenge then, uh, there's not a whole lot here for me. I don't make anything better. I can't bring dead people back to life. What good do we do? We drive around California visiting unhappy people.", "And how's that going? Any progress lately?", "Nah. I was doing more good as a psychic. I was giving people hope at least. False hope, but hope anyway.", "Can I please continue working with you?", "You know I didn't mean that.", "Uh, it's not that. I mean, it' not that at all. It's just... I have nothing else to do.", "Agreed.", "No mess, I swear.", "Thank you. [He hugs her]", "Good. It was, uh, it was very good. We had a frank exchange of views.", "No.", "Wouldn't direct me to the bathroom if my ass was on fire.", "Well, I thought that went pretty well.", "Highlight for me was definitely your speech. Passionate, articulate, strong.", "We got a confession.", "It's lovely to meet you, doc. You're a horse's ass, but you mean well.", "[Points to Dr. Steiner with a stick] And I can see what you're thinking right now.", "Ah, but right before that, you were wondering whether you would choose Lisbon or Van Pelt as your concubine in that little fantasy kingdom you like to go to sometimes.", "Kristin Marley, Lady Senator's aide, rumored romance with the senator's husband.", "Oh, I trained myself to hear and take in information while asleep.", "Yes, they did.", "[Lying on the couch] Wow. There's a stain on the ceiling that looks like Elvis, but today it looks more like a basset hound.", "Oh, that was very exciting.", "Used. Used a corpse. There's no \"ab\".", "I didn\u2019t see it. Of course.", "He\u2019s in love with you.", "I know, hard to fathom, but... uh, there\u2019s no accounting for taste, is there?", "It's interesting isn't it?", "Hmm.", "Well, I'm not gonna give up that easily.", "Oh, Lisbon, hey.", "All right. It's...it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine, all right? I promise.", "What if something bad happened and you're blocking it out?", "Well, let me hypnotize you so we can be sure.", "Why not?", "So you're going down the steps, relaxing with each step, and now you reach the bottom, the very last step, the ultimate place of calm. How are you feeling?", "Good. You're going to remain in this relaxed trance state while we think about Tuesday night. But first, sometimes you dance to that Spice girls CD, don't you?", "I thought so. [He grins] Now, Tuesday. You can watch whole day like it's a movie. Every detail is in focus. You can zoom into any moment you want. You can fast forward, rewind. You are in total control. Okay?", "Good. What do you see?", "Is he?", "[looks a bit put out] Let's fast forward a little. Later in the day, you're about to leave CBI.", "Suicide? No. If she did, she wouldn't blame the bureau.", "No, she didn't do it. She loved him.", "People trapped in miserable lives, always talk about escaping. Few actually do it. It's easier just to close your eyes and pretend the misery doesn't exist.", "You know, you're a very good liar. Most people subconsciously signal dishonesty, but you? There's nothing. No inner conflict. Usually, that's the mark of what shrinks like to call a sociopath.", "You can buy logo merchandise, Sinner Saints coffee mugs, decals, beach towels. Whoa! And some various other interesting little knickknacks.", "Yeah. Well, if they do it, we should do it. A range of casual wear, maybe? Sensible shoes?", "[To himsel] Lisbon loafers.", "Me, I see a difficult childhood, bad parenting, a lot of torment. But I also see how that suffering gave you great powers of empathy and a strong creative side and those are the qualities you should try and nurture in yourself. Not this brutish character you try to hide behind.", "Oh, it's lovely.", "It's a lovely crime scene.", "Okay, I needed Lucas to see Felicia get arrested, you needed hard evidence to charge Felicia. So...I made it happen.", "Yes, you're right. She does deserve some justice.", "You know, sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.", "What's up, my brothers?", "Yes, they did. Thank you very much.", "So modest.", "Yes. Yeah. It's a little farfetched. He does love you. How could he not? But he's not the type to bend his principles over love. So I figure it's something more concrete. You must have something on him.", "Yes. Something he did wrong. Something very bad that you know about. Now he's not the type to steal or do drugs, so my guess? He hurt someone. He killed him. A bad guy that he couldn't catch any other way.", "Yes and you helped him do it. No. You found out after the fact and you let him off the hook because the bad guy deserved it.", "I'm touched that you would risk your career over me. That means a lot to me.", "I'm grateful and all, but let's not go crazy here.", "Well we have a whole range of expensive stunts if you don't like the cheap ones.", "She alright?", "Well, thank kevlar actually.", "This is beautiful. [places the crown on Lisbon's head]", "So is it usual that your uncle is here after closing?", "Oh, I'm sorry. The man that has sex with your aunt then.", "No, don't say that. This is a murder investigation. I can be as hard ass as I'd like to be. Thank you.", "Oh yeah, that's right. He's not dead. Uh... well I apologize for my rudeness. Heh.", "I deduce from the irritated tone of your phone conversation that I was right about Carl Ward.", "Go on.", "Half?", "It's funny, isn't it? The big regrets in life people keep to themselves.", "Nice one. A zinger. High and tight.", "Baseball academy I was thinking. Don't we have the Silvas thing?", "Why? No, no. Wasn't her. Murder weapon was a baseball bat. Baseball bat. Baseball academy. Common sense.", "What do you think?", "[chuckles] Cho?", "Great. We'll all go.", "Ah-ha!", "Which way is that? [Lisbon glares at him] I'll go.", "Timpani!", "I like the way you say that. Melba-like-the-toast. So tough and command. Let me tell you something. We are state law enforcement. And we leave when we want to leave.", "She wants to leave. See ya.", "Well, it's a big secret, well kept.", "The only person who didn't know is glaring at you right now.", "Yeah, what are you gonna do?", "Hm mmm. (Jane nods his head in agreement)", "Oh very good, very good.", "Not you.", "Personally, I thought she should have gone for it. A little empty glamour would have been good for her. But, no, not our Lisbon.", "What makes you say that?", "Yeah, it's over.", "Yeah. How you gonna top that thrill?", "You make it sound so cool.", "Yet you recall my exact words. There's no shame in it. I feel that way too sometimes. Why does everyone else get to have a normal life?", "Normally you rise above such craven emotions but in this case your hands were tied. It's the rules. You're forced to do what your worst self is telling you to do anyway. Hence your tension headache.", "Nah.", "Whatever you say.", "You can dispense the cop talk, Lisbon. You can tell me what's bothering you.", "Okay.", "I understand your position. There's no reason to beat yourself up about it.", "Well, that you feel bad about Rigsby and Van Pelt.", "Well, you can't help wondering if there's a hint of jealousy and resentment in your decision.", "Message received.", "Who is this \"KS,\" by the way?", "What did you do to make him mad?", "That'll do it.", "My turn to drive.", "Oh, don't be such an old lady. Get in. Your fears are groundless.", "Who's gone?", "Man. Justice can be a harsh mistress.", "No, she doesn't! I retract that apology.", "[smiles] Glad to be of service.", "The dirt under his nails smelled like rosemary. [finds a planter of rosemary which fits a jewelry box found at the scene] Whatever was inside this box killed our man.", "There's no reason to be snarky.", "We spend a lot of time together, and when she's unhappy I'm less happy. It's human nature.", "That sounds fair. Up to a point.", "Catching killers I enjoy, but being reminded that we're just a cog in a petty, fascist machine? That is a little depressing.", "I'm going into the Drapers' lair.", "Oh yes I am. Listen, I'm a little scared, you wouldn't want me to get hurt would you?", "A hunch. They're key in this somehow.", "Well, they certainly look the part.", "You were closer.", "More lies! You have at least two guns in that car. Three?! You're the poster girl for the NRA.", "Well, we caught the bad guy.", "Most days that's enough.", "You want to go to the range and shoot something?", "No. There's no such thing as psychics.", "Oh, weary as hell, but what's the alternative?", "So, is she telling the truth?", "What are you using, dial-up?", "Synchronized swimming is the only world that springs to mind, but I'm sure you are right.", "Sure I can. [points to his car] Look.", "Well why don't we just give it to the FBI? They love that stuff.", "The new boss? I thought Hightower was boss.", "My memory is a mighty fortress, Lisbon, from which no fact ever escapes once committed. Now when you tell me boring things, I set them free immediately. It saves overcrowding.", "You just put your hand on me.", "Yes. Don't ever do that again.", "[leans in close] You ever smell a dead mouse? Remember that smell?", "Well, I just now put a dead mouse in your jacket pocket, and no matter how many times you clean that jacket you will always smell that dead mouse, and you will remember that you should never have put your hand on me.", "It's actually just a wadded up napkin, but it has the same psychological effect. The human mind is funny that way.", "Really, I'm impressed. You played me like a fish and you lied to me.", "I'm glad to see you're learning a few things. Of course, now I shall have my revenge.", "I was complimenting her on her jacket. It's a vivid color.", "You're going to call me a liar?", "Anybody that gets close to me, bad things happen to them.", "You're not listening to me.", "Oh, please. Please. Really? Okay, enough. No more pulling away. Give me a hug.", "What do you mean you can tell. You can't tell. I don't mean it, but you can't tell that I don't. You're guessing!", "How?", "No you can't tell!", "That's nonsense. You're lying. Liar, liar, pants on fire.", "Oh yeah. Her grandparents are carnie royalty. They ran big metal: Ferris wheels, ghost trains. They ran them all across the midwest. My wife, she didn't want to have any part of it.", "Carnies are good people, but you're either with the show or you're not. There's nowhere in the middle, and if you're not with the show, you're a mark. You're a sucker. She didn't like that.", "[opens a side door, surprising Lisbon] Hey, Lisbon. Excellent work finding us.", "Yep.", "You're very persuasive. We'll be right out.", "You know this is the first time I've been here since the funeral?", "Because they're no here.", "Yeah, maybe.", "It's all right. It's irrational. No reason to be sad. Are you going to give them those flowers or what?", "[looks away as his eyes fill with tears] Yeah.", "If you shoot him you'll have two victims. She just went up there to see about jumping. He's trying to save her. Can I use that? [takes bull horn from deputy] Uh, Betsy? If you're going to jump, make sure to dive. Head first.", "From that height you'll just shatter bones and suffer massive internal injuries. Make sure you dive. Head first.", "Was it worth it?", "The man that killed your wife no longer exists. The time you took pursuing him, the pain, the sacrifice, was it worth it?", "Thank you.", "Why does horse manure smell so good?", "Judge Fitzwilliam will change her tune once I reveal her daughter's killer, won't she?", "This very evening.", "But you have to trust me.", "Well, if I'm wrong then we're in deep trouble, but what are the chances, really, of me being wrong twice in a row. Think about that one. Of course, if either of you have a better idea how to find Abby's body and catch her killer, please: these are not taxi doors, they're ears.", "[whispers] This isn't going to work unless you're quiet.", "What do you mean your legs are asleep? Legs don't sleep. That's absurd. Don't say that.", "And?", "Hmm. Tell her Jane says she is a self righteous embittered, old bat and she should thank me.", "Sorry.", "Yeah, a cattle prod will do that to you.", "Well, that doctor should try it himself sometime. [watches as Lisbon smiles] That was a big smile.", "You were kidnapped and delivered to me. That counts as solving one?", "But if I hadn't held off Rachel, they would have found us dead in a burned out house.", "Yes.", "Your what?", "I come through the valley of death and all you can think about is your stomach. A piece of fruit.", "An apple.", "That's just plain selfish.", "Yes, it is. You're on my couch. I'm trying to have a cup of tea. Have you finished? You called me creaky. I've been cattle prodded all week. I just want to have a rest and a cup of tea and a little sleep.", "Well that's just a sweeping statement, isn't it?

Why would he do that? It's sloppy, not his style.", "Remember the safe deposit vault was open during the robbery? I just assumed that someone took something from there, but I got it all backwards. They didn't get anything, they put something in there.", "You really want me to tell you? It's gonna ruin the surprise.", "Three guesses then. I'll give you a hint? It's not animal, or vegetable.", "You know, these shoes are actually quite comfortable. They're growing on me.", "No?", "There was a man attached to this needle. Have you seen him?", "You're gonna regret this someday.", "Well this, this paperwork. Every night you file it and forget it. You know what it's like? It's like cooking a beautiful meal and putting it straight into refrigerator, forever.", "No, I couldn't.", "Me?", "Well, I'm flattered. You flatter me, but I can't take credit for that.", "Well I think it's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.", "Yeah, Lisbon didn't call Rigsby. I did.", "Yes, but we all have our flaws. Don't we, agent LaRoche?", "No, no, it's fine, it's fine. My fault, my fault entirely. I provoked you.", "I'm okay, I'm okay. Seriously, it's not his fault. I deserved it, okay?", "Teresa Lisbon. It's a... it's a nice name.", "Why not?", "Tell me.", "Well, if you don't I'm gonna answer it.", "Then answer that.", "(pretending to be the kidnapper) You alone?", "Tell me... What are you wearing? Hahaha! Hi, how you doing? It's me, yeah! Hahaha!", "I think you guys can handle it from here.", "Yeah must have... slipped my mind. Excuse me.", "Hey! Just for that you're not gonna see a dime, not unless you do as I say! And if you don't, don't bother calling back!", "He was good. You? Eeh.", "Lisbon. So it's murder, is it?", "Ehhm, I'm kinda busy. Maybe later.", "Well I think you can do it, you're very capable.", "Okay, I'll go to the news station with you, get you started and then you're on your own, alright?", "I can't promise I'll always be around to help you Teresa. There will come a time when you might have to do this on your own. And I want you to be prepared.", "Show Volker this sketch and watch his face.", "I know you do.

She's on foot.", "Who is that guy?", "Hurts.", "You'll never know.", "Wether I engineered the escape and abduction.", "You don't know. You just guess. And you didn't tell your new best friend Kirkland either.", "No you wouldn't.", "Hahaha...", "Nothing. Sorry. All of it's worth it. She told me Red John and I are very much alike. That it's a wonder we weren't best friends from the moment we shook hands.", "Yes. He's someone I know.", "I haven't just met him, I've shaken hands with him. And she wasn't lying, she didn't realise what she told me.", "She said it's a wonder Red John and I didn't become friends. Now what we have, I consider a friendship. So, my friend, you are free and clear.", "You know Lisbon I have a great idea. A brilliant idea. Excuse me, one second.", "Well, uhm, there isn't one. I just don't want you to send that kid to a foster home.", "There's always choices.", "Let them go home. You don't have to charge her sister yet, do you? Just, just think about it for a while.", "Just let them go home.", "Well, not exactly. I like it.", "No, no need. I'm really feeling it here. I think I need to be alone with the house for a moment. You know just to check out its aura.", "Yeah. Well I'm not gonna buy a house unless we have compatible auras.", "Ten minutes.", "Something happened at the company retreat, something bad.", "We will ask whoever comes through that front door. Down.", "Come on. Hi.", "It's okay. You were talking in your sleep.", "And drooling a little.", "Well- Someone's coming.", "Obsess? I know that I've met Red John now. Shook his hand.", "I think this puzzle box is the key. Whatever is in here was important enough to hide, but not valuable enough to put in that safe.", "I don't know yet, it's a puzzle.", "Oh, no no no no. It's my puzzle. All mine.", "Already done.", "Well, ehm... Hands in the air or down on the ground? I'm a little confused.", "Patrick Jane, consultant. This isn't my boss.", "Uhm, don't know. Made him up.", "Hi Lisbon.", "How so?", "Really?", "Well he hasn't yet, but he might soon. We should meet at his hotel.", "That's right.", "Oh no, very real. It's, uh, the Vista. In Clearlake. I'll meet you there in an hour. Bye.", "See that face? That's exactly why I didn't tell you the plan.", "It's a good enough plan and Rigsby is wearing one of those ear thingies, I will talk him through the con. He'll be fine.", "Then we go back to old fashion police work. But this way we get to enjoy some room service. Please, have a seat.", "Could you pass the cheese plate? This is getting good.", "Lisbon, you're distracted and you have an eager gleam in your eye. Either you have a breakthrough in the Volker case or you're in love! Which is it?", "I was hoping it was love. You deserve happiness, but I'm glad for you anyway.", "Mmh... Yeah well, let's leave God out of it, shall we?", "Hey Cho, you're freaking out the guests. Just relax with the copness.", "Bravo.", "Excellent police work, Lisbon. I admire your pluck.", "No \u201cbut\u201d. I\u2019m just a little worried that he\u2019s inside your head. And believe me, that\u2019s not a good road to go down. Bad neighborhood.", "Well, yeah, I can certainly understand that. I just\u2026 I-I want you to be careful.", "I hope not. If you need my help, let me know.", "How did it go with Volker?", "But?", "Well why can't you?", "Well if you wanna get Volker you can't let that stop you.", "Ardiles is the deputy D.A., he's gonna have a deposition.", "Well of course not, he's a smart lawyer. You have to get something on him that will make him help you.", "Sure, why not.", "Ask yourself this: who makes it their business to know everyone else's?", "We give his name and photo to local police and the FBI department of missing persons. It's just like finding a needle in a stack of needles.", "Yes. She thinks the worst. Hard not to agree with her. What about you? Burning the midnight oil, I see.", "Mmh.", "Mr. Volker. Patrick Jane, I work with Teresa Lisbon.", "Certainly. Well that was impressive. Not only are you a super successful businessman, but you're quite the vivid story teller. For a moment there I was splashing around in that puddle with Spike growing some gills.", "Need? No. I just want to meet you when I have the chance.", "No. But you are. After your arrest things are bound to get a little hectic and I probably wanted to have to chance to introduce myself so here I am.", "You sure about that?", "No you're not. You want us to think that you're gloating, but you're not. You're afraid.", "I can see right through you. We were close searching your offices like that. Too close. You want us to think that you're in control, that you're untouchable, but you're not. You're afraid of us. And you should be.", "Oh really? What?", "Not just met, shaken hands with.", "A lot.", "How was the rest of the party?", "Ten years, huh?", "We should come by sometimes when there's not a corpse here to meet us.", "Bingo! Woooho! Bingo!", "Of course you do.", "You know people, you know how to control them. Not that you always care.", "Well, you win more flies with honey than with vinegar, but you use vinegar anyway.", "You're very fond of the fake tell, aren't you? Before you bet you look away and you breath out very slowly, like you're tring to calm yourself.", "Well, you have a tell inside the fake tell. When you're bluffing the breathing is audible.", "You get yourself a good hand and puff away like that Manchester will for sure think you're bluffing. Trust me.", "Morning.", "Little education is a beautiful thing. Speaking of which, I've upset the ecosystem of the poker game.", "Bertram's now a better poker player because of me, the ecosystem is changed. You need to adapt or die.", "Don't try to razzle dazzle me. Money talks.", "Oh I have that covered. Herbivores are worth one, carnivores are worth five.", "Deal.", "All-in.", "Really?", "No. I'm gonna smoke you.", "Normally I'd be tempted to mock your superstition, but in this case I'm inclined to agree.", "Seems like a civilized way to travel, don't you think?", "We could get on board and wait.", "Rules are just so tiresome and boring.", "Uhm, Lisbon, I'm sorry, but I think we might have to get back to the crime scene.", "Yes. But I'm worried we might have missed something because of that.", "I mean, seriously, what do you take me for?", "You, you did. Follow the evidence.", "You know what gave me second thoughts about Elise Vogelsong? She read too many murder mystery novels.", "You should try it sometimes. Now I'm gonna pursue Red John. Ciao!", "Yes.", "That's likely.", "And I know you know I know.", "Well, if they find out. They won't, unless of course you sing to the coppers.", "Well only if you look at it as a very persnickety lawyer.", "Yes. It's, it's horrible, I know. But she must have had good reason.", "Yes, I can hear myself! Julia Howard must have helped murder Lorelai's sister. Must have been there with Red John. Lorelai wouldn't do this otherwise. I trust her.", "I know.", "I will tell you.", "You're foolish doing this on your own. Let me help you.", "Playing me? How?", "There's no involvement. I feel nothing for her.", "An ultimatum? Someone is playing a little too much poker... I confess. I may have some feelings, but if I have crossed any lines it is not because I like her. I will do anything I can to get to Red John, but you have known that since the start.", "Yes I am.", "There's no reason for me to stay here.", "Discipline always comes with a price.", "We have to go back to the crime scene.", "I want a taco.", "There are worse things to play with.", "You spend your days chasing paperclips. When do you ever get the chance to nail a killer?", "Don't you think it's odd Homeland Security's fascination with a California serial killer?", "Here we go Lisbon... Gossip.", "Beautiful orchid, Grace. Well chosen, Rigsby.", "It's nice to be needed. Anything for you, Lisbon.", "Alright. I'll go talk to Buddy Hennings, love doctor, and you check out the shady bakery.", "Ah, that's because you're fan!", "It's alright Lisbon. We all have our guilty pleasures.", "What she means is ours is more of a platonic love.", "I have a very exciting assignment for you, Grace.", "These are for you. Try them on.", "Trust me, you wouldn't like them.", "Your brow is furrowed and you have that squinty look in your eye. You want to talk to me about the whole foot fetish thing that the catholic school girl in you tells you it's not necessarily appropriate.", "I mean, \"fetish\" is a strong word, but everyone has that thing. It's just human nature.", "Oh come on Lisbon. Don't deny yourself that freedom. There's definitely something out there that works for you, something that flips your switch. Like turtlenecks.", "Turtlenecks it is.", "Well, truth is, you're a hard man not to help, LaRoche. You're like a Shar-Pei puppy that's rolled onto its back. You have to rub its belly.", "No, no, I'm happy to rub your belly.", "I hope not.", "He's not gonna tell me voluntarily. It's embarrassing to him and deeply personal.", "Yes. How could you not want to investigate?", "Two years ago, I hired a petty thief to break into LaRoche's safe for a list of Red John suspects.", "Yeah, and I hope you learned something. (Lisbon hits him)", "Please. A-and what if dolphins were actually aliens from another galaxy? That would be kind of cool.", "It was Red John.", "We'll see.", "You tell me.", "Very well.", "No.", "Hmm. Interesting guess. No.", "Nope.", "(at the crime scene) This is Red John.", "Because when it's him, I can feel it.", "I don't understand.

Now go back, show me the grass.", "We agreed it yesterday.", "It's hardly my fault you weren't listening.", "I don't know, how often are you away?", "...No.", "I don't know.", "Oh, apparently yes.", "What for?", "Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients.

It is a fact I believe brides tend to favor exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there I feel.

Any meeting, any appointment, you have to show up early, make sure you are not followed; make sure the area is secured; check out the other guy's advance team and see how well he is prepared.

You read magazines, sip coffee, and every once in a while someone tries to kill you.", "[V.O.] In a fight, you have to be careful not to break the little bones in your hand on someone\u2019s face.

Everybody is always looking for a good one.", "[V.O.] Truth is, identity theft isn't hard. A number and an ID is all you need to drain a bank account and return some money to some very surprised retirees. But why stop there?

Why not use it to threaten federal judges and insult the local drug cartel? Most fun I've had in Miami.", "Pretty much. It's not so bad as safe houses go. You got a TV at least. I once spent three days in a Riyadh storage facility with nothing but a flashlight and an Arabic celebrity magazine.", "[V.O.] When you go on the run, the first thing you do is lay down tracks in the opposite direction, but that only works if the bad guys find the trail and believe it's for real, which means selling it. You need to put on a little show, make them feel clever. When you make somebody work to get a piece of information they'll believe it that much more because it's hard to get.", "[To Sam] Well, I'll tell you what, if there's a situation that requires showing off your upper body and boozy flirting, you're my guy.", "[V.O.] International conferences attract spies for the same reason hotel bars attract hookers: you can do business and drink for free.", "Fun?

If killing a witness to save a valued employee from jail time is the best way to keep making money, they'll do that.

It's heavy and dense; dead weight. If it's on fire, of course, that complicates things further.", "[V.O.] As a rule, spies don't like dealing with cops. Covert ops are illegal by definition. If they were legal they wouldn't need to be covert.", "[V.O.] You can tie up a lot of resources by keeping a bugged phone line open. As long as it's open they're supposed to keep listening.

But I'm sure they'll take it under advisement.", "[V.O.] Military firebombs are typically white phosphorus or chlorine trifluoride. These are remarkably effective, but they are also unstable, lethally toxic, and hard to find at the grocery store. The main ingredient in a homemade firebomb, on the other hand, is Styrofoam. A military demolition expert can put something together in a few hours. An IRA trained guerrilla can do it in twenty minutes... give or take.", "[V.O.] In any new job there's always friction with your co-workers. They are wondering if the boss likes the new guy better, if he's going to make them look bad... In some jobs that can get you a dark look in the break room; in other jobs that can get you a bullet in the back of the head.", "[V.O.] In intelligence work, surveillance is called coverage. It's like basketball; you can run zone defense or man-to-man. Man-to-man is risky; follow someone too long and they're going to get suspicious. Zone is usually the way to go. Stay put and let targets come to you. Less obvious, easier on the feet... and you can catch up on your celebrity gossip.", "I'm helping people; you're running guns! Big difference!", "Do you have guns in the trunk, Fi?!", "You have unregistered weapons in a stolen car, Fi!", "[V.O.] Clandestine meetings are never fun to arrange. It's a big part of the job for a covert operative but it's never pleasant. It's not so much the fear of death that bothers you, it's driving to the meeting with a bag over your head... Sometimes they wash the bag, sometimes they don't.", "Next time Lawrence, go limp. It's really hard to drag a human shield.", "[V.O.] The thing about security is that the very things that protect you can be turned against you by someone who knows what he's doing. It's tough to compromise a well thought-out security system, but making someone think you can compromise it, well, that's much easier. Take surveillance cameras, for example: you can disable one by shooting a laser at it and overloading the light sensitive chip. Cheap, easy, and exactly the sort of thing a sophisticated criminal gang with lots of resources would do. Leave around some tell-tale signs of surveillance like cigarette butts, a forgotten camera lens cap and the more security there is, the more likely they are to think they've got a very serious problem. Even the security team itself can be an opportunity. The more employees you have, the more you have to worry about them. Deliver some vague threats and a few hundred bucks to a security guard. If he's honest he'll tell his boss, who then wonders who wasn't so honest. For the cost of a nice dinner you can get a whole security team canned.", "[V.O.] Rescuing a hostage isn't about battering rams and guns. Charge through a door with a gun and chances are the person you're trying to save will be the first one lying on the floor dying of acute lead poisoning. So you come up with alternatives: ingredients from the local pharmacy, mixed with aluminum foil, powdered in a coffee grinder will make a serviceable flash grenade that would stun anyone for a good 20 feet. Thermite is another handy tool: with a surface temperature of a thousand degrees, it's used to weld together railroad ties. It would make pretty short works of most locks too.", "So you understand? You pick up the package and walk away. Got it?", "You don't look at us, you don't talk to us, you just walk out with the video. Fiona and I will be watching to see if the kidnappers have someone there and Sam will follow in the car if he sees anyone leave.", "No, Nick; focus. You just walk away.", "Yes, we will be there. Okay, go ahead. [Nick tries to get out but the door is locked.] Unlock it first.", "[V.O.] The thing about doubling anyone is that the more they do for you, the deeper they get. The deeper they get, the more you can make them do. Great if you're running them, but hard on the source. The suicide rate is... above average.", "[V.O.] The art of turning someone into a double agent is delicate. The target has to be put into a fragile psychological state.", "[V.O.] Fortunately, fragile psychological states are a specialty of Fiona's.", "Fine, call him. You broke your foot walking down the stairs at the mall, you forgot to call.", "There you go.", "That's vague.", "[V.O.] Facts are the hallmark of a good false identity. It is harder to create history than it is to alter it. Plus, the more truth to your lie, the easier it is to remember.", "Fine.", "You made your point, Fi.", "Yep, you did.", "[V.O.] A basic rule of covert ops is let someone else do your dirty work. Let someone else find the guy you want to kill. It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.", "[V.O.] Just because there are no windows or doors doesn't mean there are no exits. The thing to look for is an air conditioner unit, that's where the wall is weakest. Also, people watch doors; they don't watch air conditioners.", "It'll look great over my shirt.", "[V.O.] The truly paranoid don't go to meetings themselves. They use a cut out, someone unrelated to them hired to show a pre-arranged sign and deliver a message. The sign is something innocuous but hard to miss. My favorite is a tourist guide for Madison, Wisconsin. No one will look at it twice, but unless I'm in the Midwest, I know they are waiting for Michael Westen.", "Hey Nate, you look clean. You shaved the ferret off your face.", "That'll kill you, you know?", "No. The bucket of trans fat you've got there.", "If we need more than this, we're doing something very wrong.", "[V.O.] When you work in intelligence, you get used to the idea that some information is worth risking everything for. You sign up for the lifestyle, or the chance to serve your country, or the millions of frequent-flier miles. But finally, it all comes down to putting your ass on the line to learn something.", "[V.O.] There are some fights you just can't win. A force can be so overwhelming that no tactical approach in a fight is going to lead to a victory worth having. When you can't win in a fight, sometimes you have to settle for making sure that if you lose, everyone loses. It works for nuclear weapons; it works for me.", "[V.O.] For any operative, stashing weapons is second nature after a while. Spies hide guns like squirrels hide acorns. You never know when you'll need some firepower, or where you'll be when you need it.", "I'm Michael Westen. I used to be a spy.", "[V.O.] A great way to get people talking about their security is to put them on the defensive. Accuse a guy of having bad locks and before you know it he's telling you where his motion detectors are.", "[V.O.] When you're claiming to be someone you're not, the key is commitment. You've got to sell it like your life depends on it, because sometimes it does. One reason to work with the same people is you know each other's moves, so if you shoot at your team in the middle of an operation, they know to go with it.", "[V.O.] Private military companies are best known for their bodyguard work. It's a big part of their business, but it's not the only part. For a big enough check, they'll rain hot lead down wherever you want. It's not work that attracts service-with-a-smile types.", "Seems the people who burned me want me for a job. For now, that's all I got.", "More of a \"we'll kill you if you don't do it\" type of thing.", "[V.O.] When you work as a spy, it's easy to think of people as assets. Resources to accomplish a goal. Because you don't have a personal relationship with an asset. You don't care about an asset. You don't miss the scent of an asset when she leaves the room.", "[V.O.] If you wanna make a friend, solve a problem for them. No problem to solve? Create one.", "That stalker happens to have a MAC-10 in his jacket! Oh\u2014 you knew, didn't you?!", "[V.O.] Most people think distracting a group of guys is best done by a beautiful woman. The problem with beautiful women is people want them to stick around, which can cause a lot of problems. Obnoxious guys, they just want to get rid of.", "That's... a lot.", "Fi, get me a sniper rifle and some C4.", "Mom, I gotta get to work, actually. Uh, what is it you need?", "That is tragic.", "Friend, you're ruinin' my ratio. I have a good ratio goin' on, I got four ladies to one Davis. Four-to-one, I like that.", "I was trying to say \"black pants\". My Urdu's a little rusty.", "[V.O.] To win a negotiation you have to show you're willing to walk away. And the best way to show you're willing to walk away... is to walk away.", "[V.O.] Get your hands on any classified document worth having, chances are it's going to be redacted, which makes reading it a lot like watching a movie on an airplane: all the juicy parts are missing but you still get the basic idea.", "It was \"juice\"; I was there, his first word was \"juice\".", "[V.O.] One of the hardest things to do in a fight is to make it look like you're trying to kill someone without doing any permanent damage. They don't teach any half-moves in combat training. There are moves designed to kill and maim as efficiently as possible. If those are off limits, one option is open your fist right before a punch lands. Painful, but the force is distributed. Another showy option is a kick to the shoulder. You might break a rib or two; but if you aim right, nobody is going to the morgue.", "[V.O.] A fight is one of the quickest ways to tell if someone isn't who they say they are.

People have too much faith in padlocks.", "I'd say nothing. Nothing's good. Go with nothing.", "[V.O.] Sometimes, when you meet a new operative, it's a good idea to open with an aggressive move. You learn about people when you make them play defense: their reflexes, weaknesses, how they handle themselves under pressure. And even if they are able to counter, it never hurts to know how far they're willing to go.", "[V.O.] When meeting a covert operative for the first time, the arrangements can tell you a lot: if they give you a map and a photo, they trust you; a place and a time, they want to check you out before they make contact; a cryptic clue like \"tidy pelican\", they've just got an irritating sense of humor.", "I don't like your whining. Are you gonna pout all night?", "[V.O.] Dealing with a trained operative is like playing chess with a master.

You start with a target. You're looking for just the right person to approach. People in the inner circle are usually too tough to go after. Anyone with real power is bound to be cautious.

That's why I'm here. Is this just...horribly wrong?", "It makes...my whole life...every man I've ever loved, make sense. It's like I've always been looking for someone like Dexter or someone who's the opposite of Dexter as a way to avoid the fact that I'm in love with him.

Nothing that a little white-out can't take care of.", "Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?", "Faith and begorrah! A fellow potato eater! My real name's McGill. The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys. They all want a pipe-hitting member of the tribe, so to speak.", "Oh my God! You really are a chemistry teacher! Heh-heh. Uh, you mind? [Saul closes the door] I was terrible at chemistry. I'm more of a humanities guy.", "We should talk about that. It should be much, much harder for people to track you down. My P.I. charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.", "Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers.", "C'mon. Have you seen my hourly rate? Heh-heh. Oh by the way, where do you keep the money? Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard, huh? You know, this kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last. And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?", "What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?", "No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch, you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make, better call Saul!", "Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering?", "How long you been doing this?", "Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru.", "Look, let's start with some tough love, alright? Ready for this? Here it goes: you two suck at peddling meth. Period.", "Well, look at that. It's got PayPal and everything.", "[sarcastically] Yeah, there's no deep-seated issues there.", "It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster \u2013 for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! \"My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!\" And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.", "It's me. [about Skyler] We may have a wife problem.", "Is this a good or bad thing?", "It's a bad thing.", "I'm sorry?", "That's just my meticulousness. Don't bog down in detail, Walt. The lesson here\u2013", "...Yeah. But I didn't know it was your house, did I? You moved out. Besides, you basically told me to.", "You strongly hinted that I should. You were worried about your wife, remember? You were concerned that she might say something to the police.", "Let's not get lost in the who, whats and whens. The point is we did our due diligence and she didn't talk. She kept quiet, she stood by you, Walt. Which, if you ask me, is the ironical silver lining here.

Hey, I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?!", "You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!", "Clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate when he paid you half of Jesse's earnings. He must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways.", "I knew I could count on you boys to play nice! That's...that almost brings a tear to my eye.", "Whoa, Walt, hold on there! What was the offer, if I may ask?", "You're gonna need that money laundered, right? I mean, of course. What was our deal before? Seventeen percent. That's a shade high. Now let's settle on an even fifteen. That's a nice round number.", "Fourteen's fair.", "Thirteen.", "Twelve, for old time's sake. Twelve.", "I'm a reasonable guy, it's a short term deal. Ten even, but I can't go any lower and still respect myself. [Walter turns to leave] Five!", "It's the way of the world, kid. Go with the winner.", "OK, I'm listening.", "What RV?", "OK, what exactly does \"knows about\" mean? Does he have it? Has he searched it?", "So get rid of it! What are you sitting there talking to me? Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it. You don't go near it.", "Jesus. Plan A, then! Go, get to it before the feds do.", "What do I look like \u2013 the RV disposal people? Did you not plan for this contingency?", "Well, next time plan for it, would ya? The Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.", "Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the big, beautiful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.", "We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment.", "Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Laser tag. [silence] Laser tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County!", "Yeah, there's guns and glow lights, and the kids wear the vests and they're split into teams...", "Makes more sense than you two being together. I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.", "It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lasers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so...", "You want your criminal associate taken into police custody?", "Pinkman in jail. I dunno, I'm picturing it...", "That's jail.", "Look, Mike, there are rules to this lawyer thing.", "Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, \"Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?\" Y'see, so, then where's the trust?", "Yeah, that's...an argument.", "So where were we?", "Yeah, um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell.", "Motivation? Uh, as in motivation motivation? Just so we're on the same page here, you're saying we'll make him an offer he can't refuse?", "Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper. Well, I know an audit can be highly motivating. I know a gal over at Tax & Revenue, you give her ten minutes in this Bogdan fella's books, she'll have his sky raining frogs.", "Alright, how about an ICE raid? You know he's got illegals working over there. I mean, he just has to.", "Yeah, and also you're gonna need them after you take over. Hey, how about terrorism? \"Oh, Agent Hoover I gotta tell ya, I've seen some real Islamic comings and going over there at the car wash. Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that.\" Heh-heh.", "OK, well, we're just spitballin' here, so...", "Look, there's always, \"You gotta real nice place here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.\" That angle.", "Attitude adjustment.", "Well, that clears things up.", "Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but in this business \u2013 and Walt can back me up on this \u2013 the number one rule is, \"Don't take things personal.\"", "OK, uh, speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna go on record and say this is a bad idea. Now I advise against\u2013", "Yeah.", "Oh, Christ.", "Yeah yeah! [Saul hurries over to a locked safe.] You understand there's no coming back from this? You're gonna get new Socials and new identities. You can't contact your friends or relatives ever again.", "How are you gonna sell this to that wife of yours.. and your teenage son?", "You're wanted by some pretty scary individuals, not to mention the law. You're a high-risk client. You're gonna need the deluxe service. It's gonna cost you.", "The last quote I got on the deluxe was 125 grand. But you've got four people to vanish. It's gonna be at least half a million. And he accepts cash only.", "Here!", "What'd you expect, Hadji's Quick Vanish?!", "Take a break, H.T. Let's go.", "Yeah, yeah, stop showing off for the client.

He meant it.", "Don't.", "You don't have to do\u2013 You answer that phone and Schrader's on the other end of the line with a legal wire tap recording everything you say, you're not doing anybody any favors, except for him. In fact, why do you still have a battery in that thing? Take it out. They might be trying to triangulate your movements. I'm not being paranoid. Do it.", "She just panicked.", "I'm not saying it's not bad. It's bad. But it could be worse.", "What does she actually know? What has she seen, hmm? Nothing. It's hearsay. It's all he said, she said. I mean, the only real evidence that she can lead them to is the money, and once we take care of that, well, then they got nothing.", "Yeah. I can't exactly see him turning the other cheek.", "Of course, there's always, um\u2026", "Well, have you given any thought to, um, sending him to a trip to Belize?", "Yeah, Belize. You know, where, um, where Mike went to. Off on a trip to, um, Belize.", "It's just conjecture on my part.", "Okay, it's an option that my\u2013", "It's an option that has worked very well for you in the recent past.", "My mistake. Family. Off limit. Of course. I'm just throwing thoughts out there. This is a safe room, right?", "Agent Schrader. Beat any good suspects lately? [to the two detectives] Hey, tall and taller, ask him his history with my client. He knocked the poor kid unconscious last time they were alone together.

Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.", "He a no-show? Why didn't you call? Why didn't you... [Jesse punches Saul in the face] Stop! [Jesse keeps hitting him] Code Red! Huell! Get in here!

I had Huell lift your dope. I told you I couldn't risk the guy not taking you.", "What?", "Okay, Jesse. Calm down.", "I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. I had Huell lift your cigarette, but Walt made me! He told me he was helping you, he was saving you. I never would've agreed to it if I'd known what he was gonna do. Jesse, you gotta believe me. I didn't want any of this!", "Nothing.", "I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but who are we hitting?", "I don't know any hitmen.", "You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice, just for old times' sake? You're worried about your wife and kids? Don't leave. The way things are right now, some people \u2013 not me, mind you, but some people \u2013 might say you're leaving her high and dry.", "The phone call was a smart move. Kudos to you. Odds are it was recorded. It's gonna play great for a jury. It might even buy her a mistrial \u2013 in a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they're going after her.", "Well too bad for her, then she's got nothing to trade. I hate to be a downer here, but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead. You think the Feds are gonna just let that go 'cause you hit the ejector seat? First thing they're gonna do, they will RICO your wife and kids out of the house. That condo is gone. Your bank accounts, they're frozen. Her picture's probably on TV right now, next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?", "Well, I don't mean to contradict you, but getting it to her? Impossible. The Feds are just praying that you'll make contact. The Internet, the phone, it's all tapped. Hey, Mike was no dummy. But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter, it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.", "Stay. Face the music. Hey, I mean, how much time have you got left? You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of Metropolitan Detention Center...", "...How bad is that?

Everyone missed something that day.", "Everyone lies in this business, I accept that. But we all draw lines somewhere, and the two sides of that line are us and them.

A month? What?", "The new job was just a ploy. Your way of letting me down gently.", "Sounds perfect.", "Mr. Al-Zahrani, I'd like you to go back to your house now.

Still feels.", "Before you dig that hole any deeper, I have to show you something. Is this your computer?", "[removes a flash drive from his breast pocket] Here. I'll only fuck it up.

I don't want to. He's all I've got. Nothing else could love me, not even \u2026 especially not me. Or is that just a lie the Dark Passenger tells me? Because, lately, there are these moments that I feel connected to something else. Someone.

In terms of who goes, it boiled down to a philosophical question: which one of us has more inherent worth?", "First I considered our value to the community. That was a wash. We're both loyal civil servants, we work hard to keep the city clean.", "Then I looked at our personal lives, and \u2026 well, it's where the differences became clearer.

I didn't.", "Of course I have a conscience. I left you a place to shit, didn't I?

That my life is one tragic mistake?", "Did you happen to be stuffing a human leg into a garbage bag at that point?", "[voiceover] Harry's heart gave out when he saw what's inside me. He thought he could tame it, give it a purpose, help it find a place in the natural order. Guess he was wrong.", "[voiceover] It won't be long now. I can hang this on Doakes and then \u2026 then what? Years of trials and appeals. With him pointing his finger and calling me killer. For such a neat monster I'm making an awfully big mess.", "In the long run it would be easier on Deb. Rita. Better than watching me dragged in like an animal. Which, let's face it, will happen. Some day.", "I really enjoyed our conversations, James. I lie to everyone I know. Except my victims, right before I kill them. It's hard to establish much of a rapport there. Sorry about the cage.", "[voiceover] Sleep, what a concept. I can't believe I actually contemplated turning myself in. This is so much better than a prison cell. I can squeeze fresh orange juice, savor a fine French roast, grab a morning workout. Okay, working out I could have done in prison. But still, I'm free.", "To know what it's like. To feel something that deeply. Anything. That's why you hang out in recovery groups. You're emotionally colorblind.

But you have no idea what any of those things actually feel like.", "[voiceover] It's strange to have a creation out there. A deeply mutated version of yourself, running loose and screwing everything up... I wonder if this is how parents feel.", "[voiceover] Not long ago I had a dream that people could see me for what I am. And for a brief instant in time, the world actually saw my bodies of work. Some even cheered. But as it turns out, nobody mourns the wicked. Sorry, James.", "[voiceover] When something beyond reason happens, it turns skeptics into believers. Believers in a higher power.

Twisted commandments handed down from the only God I ever worshipped. One through ten... Don't get caught - that I got covered. But killing someone without knowing if he's guilty... I'd love some help on this one...but my God is dead now.", "[Voiceover:] Harry finds me sitting in a pool of blood, turns me into his own personal vendetta machine, and when he sees the monster he created in action, he kills himself.", "[Voiceover:] I have moved on from my father, but I still need his code, now more than ever. But it has to evolve, become my own.", "[Voiceover:] Harry - the last person I'd turn to for advice on parenthood.", "[Voiceover:] I promised Rita I'd be back in an hour.

And my weaker brethren reward me with gifts.", "How else would you do it?", "Rita's pregnant.", "Rita's pregnant.", "I'm not lying.", "Well, I've never heard it described in quite those words before, but yeah.", "What else did the doctor say?", "[Voiceover]: Like \"Mom was killed by a chainsaw, my brother was killed by...well, me.\" That kind of stuff? [to Rita] No, I don't really know anything.", "Yeah, I'll grab some glasses. [Voiceover]: Showing up late at night like this, is it creepy, or just what friends do?", "[Voiceover on getting CAT-scanned]: It seems ironic that I, an expert on human dismemberment, have to pay $800 to have myself virtually dissected.", "[Voiceover]: So there it is. I'm going to be a father, and raise my child. It's what any good man would do. After all...it's a jungle out there.", "[Voiceover]: Role playing. It's such an important part of growing up. When we were kids, whatever role Deb assigned me - evil monster, treacherous Nazi, horrible alien - I played them to perfection. The only roles I had trouble with were the good guys - heroes, knights in shining armor. It just never felt right.", "We're having a baby.", "You can have a puppy and a baby.", "[Voiceover]: Masuka - he's chosen the role of court jester. Now we only like him when he's making us laugh. Still, there's something said for being a character actor. The lead players with all those emotions must be exhausting.", "[Voiceover]: Most actors toil in obscurity, never stepping into the spotlight. But if you hone your craft, work diligently, you might just find yourself cast in the role of a lifetime.", "[Voiceover:] There are many ways to stop the heart. Electric shock, bad diet... Sever the aorta - my personal favorite.", "Lying naked on a table, helpless, no thanks.", "[Voiceover:] Clemson Galt has been on my top ten list for years, and Miguel could be a big help. But the goal here isn't to satisfy my need, it's to get Miguel to find a new hobby.", "The meaning of life?", "I'll see what I can do about finding you the perfect Key lime pie.", "[Voiceover on Ellen Wolf]: Do I see sheets of plastic in your future?", "[Voiceover]: It's said that everything is connected to everything. The butterfly effect... You drop a pebble in a pond and the ripples radiate outwards, touching and affecting everything.", "[Voiceover]: Freebo's dead, and now there's a tree-trimmers' convention in here. It seems random, but it's not. The butterfly effect again. Off course, it's an odd sensation when you happen to be the butterfly.", "You ever drop a quarter of milk? Watch it spread over the whole kitchen floor, the mess it makes?", "There's six quarts of blood in the human body. This isn't gonna be pretty.", "[Voiceover]: I tell Miguel to be inconspicuous, and what does he do? He shows up looking like the Unabomber.", "You were wrong. It went well.", "You can't admit it. He did good.", "Of course.", "[Voiceover: Something to look forward to.]", "Well, the ME's report on the other victims suggests the skinner starts slow - probably to build fear. Anton's a big guy - a lot of skin.

But soon, maybe tomorrow, Miguel will know exactly how I feel because finally there's an emotion I don't have to fake.

It's a holdover from the last ice age when food was scarce and men had to work together to take down such a large beast. Those who worked well with others survived, and their genes have been passed through the centuries until they landed here, in this...my community.]", "[Voiceover: The danger of community is that the people who don't belong are looked upon with suspicion.

I was thinking like I wasn't a spy. Okay. I was trying to have a little bit of fun. And I knew the second I called you two, it would all be over!", "Is it really so wrong for me to want a night off? I was having a really good time, too, until the assassins stole my pants and tried to kill me. I've earned it. I deserve it.", "I'm losing consciousness.", "Yeah I know, I know...I saw you shoot that FULCRUM agent on Christmas Eve. After they took over the Buy More. And when I asked you about it...", "Yeah.", "I know that. I...I...I know that you do. You were protecting me, you were protecting all of us. He had threatened my family, my friends, and you were just doing your job. I get that but... Sarah, the guy was unarmed. And, and you just...", "That part I'm not sure I'll ever get used to.", "Well, gotta run. You know how it is...the old ball and chain.", "No flashes, no nothing. I think our neighbors are clean. Except for that lady across the street. She's got a dirty mouth.", "Charles Carmichael always comes quickly.", "Casey, I'm handcuffed.", "Really?", "I'm not going to break my bone!", "I guess something that's been wrong from the start. You know?", "No, no, no, no, no. Trust me. Sarah's not going anywhere.", "Look El, I know how much you love Sarah. And I know how much you love the idea of us, and us moving forward with you and Devon, but we're not anything like you guys.", "Yeah, I know. I guess, but being in that house with her, it was so close to being perfect. The way I had always pictured it would be. Then I realized what was wrong with that picture...And it was us. Sarah and I are never going to be anything more than we are now right now. And you know what? I'm okay with that.", "Honestly, I'm more surprised by the other 20%, Jeff. Look, buddy, I know you're going through a tough time, but I don't feel comfortable stalking another human being.", "Which is stalking.", "I can't betray my best friend. How come nobody gets that?", "Yeah, that's, Thanks, Casey. Yeah. Semper Fi. Semper Fi! You know it's a pretty upside down world when this guy's the one picking up the emotional nuances around here.", "I'm helping Ellie and Awesome find a band for their wedding.", "You're going to help me find a band?", "Um wait, wait a minute, you guys have a band?", "That seems very fitting.", "Obviously not.", "You know you say that, but I don't think you have a clue what it means. Look, Sarah, I don't have parents. I mean not really. I don't really talk about it because that's the way things are now. But it wasn't always this way. Morgan was there the first day that my mom took off. He didn't say much. Because honestly what is a fifth grader supposed to say? But we sat there and split a cherry cheesecake and played Legend of Zelda all night long. And my dad, well that's-that's a whole other story. But Morgan was there for that too. Morgan is more than just my best friend. He's my family. Before you got here, and long after you've gone, Morgan is my family.", "Yeah, you do.", "Ooh! Ugh! Oh my God! This is unbearable! My back is killing me, my wrists are chafing!", "A what? A one? I'd say I'm at least at an 8.", "This is the pre-torture? Okay, okay, put me down for a 1.", "Well I...fainted and hit my head on the ground.", "Hey! I fainted on purpose. That was my move. You know I'm terrified of needles.", "We have different methods.", "Ellie, Awesome, I have made a very important decision. I am moving out...", "And moving in with Morgan.", "What exactly does that mean?", "Are you sure about this? I mean he's a really tough guy. Maybe he won't talk.", "[to Jeff and Lester] Excuse us. [aside to Morgan] Are you crazy? What other things could she possibly be loving you for? I mean honestly, buddy, you know that I love you, but-but you're lucky to have a girl in your life who loves you for you, even though you are in fact you.", "If you don't stop testing her, she's gonna choose to be with someone else. And then you will have realized, and unfortunately too late, that you lost the catch of a lifetime. [Chuck walks away]", "Sarah, I'm not gonna move in with you...Because I can't...And you know why I can't...I'm crazy about you. And-and I always have been. But, you know, having a fake relationship, that's one thing. But living together is...I mean everyday and being around each other and-and...and that's why I can't do it. And I hope you understand.", "Thank you.", "Oh and, uh, just so you know, I am going to get this thing out of my head, one day. I will. And when I do, I'm going to live the life I want with the girl I love. Because I'm not going to let this thing rob me of that. I won't.", "Uh, sir. They don't have any guns. I personally put this mission together, and I forbade them from packing.", "I don't know. I just, you know-I think guns make things too easy. I like my spies to be tough. Look, you're not going to shoot anyone, right?", "What? You're coming here?", "General, you don't want the Intersect out of my head, do you?", "Please, please hesitate.", "No. Listen to the man, he's right. I'm no spy.", "Of course. Am I not wearing a doctor's coat? Who else would I be if not one of this man's doctors?", "Ah, Doctor.", "Doctor.", "And, doctor.", "Yes, yes, we will be discussing doctor things that only doctors understand, please go. [whispers to Alex] Please don't go.", "Oh my God, I'm bleeding. Oh my God I'm bleeding, oh my God I'm bleeding.", "I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding. I'm sorry, I get a little woozy at the sight of blood.", "I know, a little ironic, right?", "We're gonna die.", "We're gonna die.", "No. Look, I'm not listening to you. Okay?", "Wait, General, um, I'm sorry but, but isn't the most important part of being my handler making sure I stay alive?", "Thanks...Um, General. What I'm trying to say is that I-I think that maybe because my relationship with Sarah is so...you know, we're-we're-we're close. We care about each other. That's-that's what I'm trying to say. And-and I know it's not protocol or whatever but it's those feelings that wound up saving my life.", "[to Sarah and Casey dressed as nerds] Either this is a mission or you two are very good at hiding your hobbies.", "I can't believe this. My father invented the intersect.", "What? Complicate a few things; Dad, I saw you die. I saw you explode in a helicopter.", "Wait. Are you saying that you are gonna overwrite my brain?", "No we're not.", "Yes, yes we are.", "That's preposterous.", "Yes, yes I am.", "I'm sorry. They're sending you back to prison.", "It's okay. I'm sorry about your Uncle Bernie. I had no idea the Morgan was so lethal.", "I'll do my best.", "I owe you an apology.", "I was beginning to think that I couldn't trust you anymore, Sarah. That maybe Jill was right. That the CIA was never gonna let me go, that they would always put their best interests ahead of mine...But not you. You've always looked out for me. Thank you.", "Why?", "[Sarah has just taken him on the run] You're disobeying orders for me? You're committing treason, Sarah; you could go to jail.", "So ah, as you can see, just the one bed. A little presumptuous I guess. Should I have asked for separate rooms?", "I'm gonna assume that whole out-of-sight thing doesn't really apply right now.", "No. No. We came back here for you because Fulcrum's here.", "I'm not leaving without Sarah.", "End me? Oh yeah, how are you going to do that? You don't have a gun.", "You can't kill me with that radiator. It is far to confined in this car for you to get the appropriate torque.", "Yeah. Yeah. You could probably do that.", "Yeah, more or less, yeah.", "What? No gun for me?", "C'mon, the whole \"stay in the car\" thing, aren't we past this? I think I'm perfectly capable of handling myself on a mission.", "Sarah, don't! Don't, I've come this far; if he's gonna stop me he's gonna have to kill me.", "What!? Casey, my father is here! You said you would rescue him; you gave me your word. I thought that would've meant something. I guess I have a lot to learn.", "...Casey, would you like to help us rescue my father?", "Done. Hey, hey the team's back together again! Group hug!", "In the car I go.", "Hey, I was wondering if you, uh, you wanted to come to my sister's rehearsal dinner?", "I\u2019m not asking you as the asset. I'm asking you as a friend.[Casey closes door] Okay, well I tried.", "I was gonna get a good champagne buzz going on at my sister's wedding followed by a nice extra-long slow dance with my date. Vocationally speaking? Oh, that? No, nothing. Nothing lined up just yet.", "Uh, well then I think my country might have the wrong number. 'Cause I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.", "See? Guys can hug.", "That's a good point.", "I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait any longer. Okay? Everyone keeps asking me what I'm going to do with my future. And the truth is I don't have a clue. All I do know is that I want you to be in it.", "No. No guns. No lies. Just us. Just like I've always wanted. I've recently come into a little bit of money. So, any place you want to go. Any place at all, as long as it's sunny with little umbrella drinks. What I'm getting at here is...Sarah Walker will you do me the honor...of taking a vacation with me?", "You knew?", "I can't believe you've known this whole time.", "Guys...I know Kung Fu.", "Not a cover, it's my life. I was fired. For real. I'm not a spy anymore and to be perfectly honest I'm not sure I ever really was.", "Maybe we should be introduced, I'm Chuck Bartowski: total loser, cheeseball addict.", "They're on their way here to save us?", "Yeah, Casey. Uh, I think you have dungarees that are older than Carina.", "And the decision that I made in Prague. I know what it looks like, I know that it looks like I chose being a spy over-over being with you. But that's not what happened. How I felt about you was real. Very, very real. And I know that you know how I felt about you for a long time, you know. But when Carina told me what you said, those three words that I've waited to hear for so long. Look Sarah, I know. You were probably very hurt. You're probably hurt that I didn't run away with you in Prague...Sarah, I love you.", "There's gotta be a contingency plan if enemy agents infiltrate my house. Like a button you push that calls that cavalry so they can swoop in and get everyone out. Where's the button?", "Really, well then maybe you shouldn't be sneaking in my room in the middle of the night.", "I had a CIA mission.", "Well you know, same old same old. Bad guy throws a fancy cocktail party. Another bad guy is trying to sell him a weapon. We bust both bad guys. Diffuse a bomb. Blah blah blah.", "Wow. This is getting entertainingly uncomfortable.", "Oh yeah. Yeah, the plan is: Sarah and I are going to sneak out of here, and save Casey. While you stay here and save the Premiere. We just gotta take care of those two guards there.", "Uh, that would be Sarah, and, uh, her fists.", "Oh, I'm not freaking out. I'll tell you why I'm not freaking out: that would require me overreacting and I don't think it's technically possible to overreact to my brother-in-law being kidnapped!", "Duck Hunt, Nintendo.", "Yeah, well, bad guys don't count carbs, buddy.", "Listen, I'm an integral member of this team, okay? My voice should be heard.", "[the flight attendant pulls a weapon on Chuck] I am so writing a letter to the airline about this.", "Most important meal of the day.", "I feel so sorry for this guy, he seems so lonely.", "What's in Dubai?", "No. Is there Anything you want to ask me?", "Okay, good talk!", "Ridiculously good looking? Wha- him, him? Meh, yeah if you're into that strong, Supermany type of a guy.", "If I have to see you with someone else, it might as well be a hero. Right?", "Who the hell is \"Bartowski\"?", "They did, huh?", "What? You're firing me from the Buy More?", "Why, because we never had sex?", "Sarah and I are over, you know.", "You know what, you're right buddy. I do love Sarah. I kept telling myself that I didn't. That I wouldn't, I couldn't but I do...Morgan, you have no idea how badly I needed to get all this off my chest. Thank you.", "Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no. Hang on-hang on a second, Morgan is not going anywhere. Okay.", "Yeah well so do a lot of people. Awesome knows and we didn't put him underground.", "Yes, we do. We have 22 reasons why we can trust him. That's the number of years that Morgan has been my best friend. And yes he has his faults,granted, but one thing he is, is loyal. And he will never betray me or my secret.", "Thank you. Look, I'm flashing, I'm a spy again because I have my best friend back. You need the intersect and I need him. So Morgan Grimes is staying exactly where he belongs which is the Burbank Buy More.", "[Watching Morgan's recording and hearing a static sound] Is that static?", "What do you mean?", "I'll always be that guy.", "[to Casey] We gotta get you reinstated, buddy. Without a license to kill you are a menace to society.", "[startled] Dah. Good, what, hi. Hi, how long...How long have you been here? Or are you really here? I...I could be asleep right now. I very well could be asleep right now. I have some of the most vivid dreams sometimes.", "Boy, you surprising them in the kitchen? That must involve a lot of travel.", "Well, ah, I guess that makes two changed men.", "Ya...Buddy I just passed my first solo spy test last night. This is it, I'm going to the show. I-I really wanted to tell you beforehand. I'm sorry that I didn't, but you know top secret. You understand.", "Oh yeah. With flying colors man...And I think we both know that I have you to thank for that. So, I...I wanted to give you a little something. [Gives Casey box ]", "I don't think they are going to miss it down in Castle. Do you?", "Honestly, everything is coming up roses right now. I've passed my test...Ah, you are joining the world of human beings. So proud of you! Kudos for that. And Sarah has invited me for dinner tonight, alone at Union Station. So...", "Yeah. Yeah, like I said, I've passed. Celebration time now.", "A good spy always is, right?", "What does all this mean? Casey. I mean technically I failed my test.", "Yeah except that I didn't do it. You did.", "But, all that means I'm not a real spy. I don't know who I am; don't know what I am.", "Hey...Why did you do it?", "Thanks.", "Look, I don't want to pester you, Sarah uh, or become some-some nuisance that you can't avoid. I've- I've seen Morgan go down that road far too many times to count. And since I've already given the fancy, eloquent version of this speech before, right now I'm just gonna be blunt and honest. I love you. One more time just because it feels really nice to say, I love you. I feel like I've been bottling this up forever. I love you.", "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm getting out of hand, but, look, you were right in Prague. You and I, we're perfect for each other and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.", "She said she couldn't be with someone who didn't believe in her. Well, I believed in her. I just didn't believe in me.", "But earlier on in my...drunken haze...I realized that I hadn't asked you a...a question. A really important question that I'd like to ask you now if that's okay. Just once for the record...Sarah, do you love me?", "Wow. I'm, uh, I'm in my underwear. I'm sitting in my underwear holding a plastic guitar. There's a very good chance I'm making a complete fool of myself, isn't there?", "I should probably put some pants on.", "What?...Uh, what?", "Wait, wait...What about my Red Test?", "So now they're in Paris, Sarah and Shaw, and Shaw, this time for real, he's working for the ring. Now I know, I know that you can't help me anymore, I-I know all that, but Sarah is gonna die without us. I can't do this alone.", "But you are a spy! You're the ultimate spy!", "Man pastries for breakfast every morning, Europe is genius!", "General just so you know, we didn't hit them, or assault them in any way. There was no physical altercation, we just dosed them with pharmaceutical grade narcotics.", "You're right that's not making it better.", "Really good I think, yeah.", "I can't hit a girl!", "This is gonna be your favorite song. [plays \"Feeling Good\" by Nina Simone]", "Look, Sarah. It's us in 30 years.", "No! No, that's not a tranq gun. I am not letting you shoot a tiger. They are endangered and majestic.", "No guns, no flash. Honey, darling, you mind telling me what you've done with our small cache of weapons?", "You actually listened to me?", "What have you done with the gun you had at the hotel?", "Why would you do that?!", "God, I can't believe this is happening.", "Wow. You really know how to make a guy feel better about his situation, Doc.", "[relieved] I love you too.", "You threw a knife at my face!", "Dad! Knife! Face! What if you were wrong?!", "No, Dad. That's all her.", "[voice-over] My name is Chuck Bartowski, and if you're reading this, it means I'm already dead. I don't know what will end up killing me but I've chosen to be a spy, and there are consequences to that. It may be my emotions that end up doing me in or a slip-up, trying to protect my friends. Or my family, who never wanted me to be a part of this. Or it could be the thing I never saw coming, but I know it's coming.", "I don't need a watch to beat you, Shaw. Come on, aren't you a little curious? I know I am. Don't you wanna know how your intersect stacks up against mine?", "Don't worry about that. I've never been more calm.", "You're under arrest.", "I'm sorry. Are you asking me to make the classic villain mistake of explaining my dastardly plot to you? You know what? I'd love to. I confess we had no idea who the Elders were or how to I.D. them so we let you do that for us, when you warned them to leave the theater. So on the behalf of the NSA, the CIA and of course your local Buy More, I'd just like to say thanks a lot.", "[while Sarah is about to leaving for a mission] What am I, what do I say? What do we...?", "That's good. I love you. I like that. I love you, too. Be safe, okay?", "Better not.", "[over the radio] Look, clearly you have no idea who I am since you only sent ten of your men to take care of me. So let me break it down for you: if you touch a hair on Sarah's head, I will do to you what I've just done to your men. Do you understand? I'm coming down there now.", "Buddy?", "This is not the opening of a TV show. This is real life.", "[As Sarah is defusing a bomb] Sarah, listen, I cannot die without you knowing that I accept you for who you are. Your weird unpacking habits, it doesn't matter to me. Nothing matters. I still love you.", "Sorry, what? What? Did I? Those weren't the best last words, were they?", "Heyo. Who do we have taking our surveillance pics? Because those are tremendous! Can you see the way...", "What? No, no, no, no, I'm just saying, clearly...is she in a bathing suit? I didn't even notice that the first time.", "Well, we don't have the authority to use the supply closet for what it is we use it for, but we do it anyway, don't we? She knows my mom.", "Good cop, bad cop.", "Okie dokie, which one am I?", "Okay.", "And Heather kept poking the topic with a needle. You're nothing like her.", "I'm not ready for parenthood either. One day, hopefully. But not now. Not yet, anyway. Who are we kidding? I'm barely on solid food myself.", "You tell me \"ready or not ready\".", "We're on a trip. One of us forgets our toothbrush. Do we share?", "Oh, oh, using the bathroom. Door open or shut?", "Preferably with the sink running or the radio on.", "[Sarah's calling Casey] He did just get shot in the leg, and is resting up. So he probably won't be available.", "We are crap communicators.", "Why are we so afraid to talk about the whole ring thing, you know? I mean we're in love, you wear your teeth-bleaching system in front of me... We should be able to talk, no?", "Well, in the meantime, let's keep going with the questions, heh? What are five words you'd use to describe your partner?", "Mmmmkay, yeah, good, close. But what about like charming, terminally handsome, incredibly intelligent...", "So, where were we on the conversations?", "Oh yes, yes. Morgan is going to need at least five hours of my time every week for Halo purposes.", "Which is going to be a challenge with my cuddling needs.", "I can't bear the thought of you getting hurt. If this thing goes off so, I want you to go. Now, please. Save yourself.", "I.. What I was... I...", "I love you, you know that? And... And I'd say that even if you weren't in the process of saving my life right now. Which, does by the way, make you about 20-25% sexier in my book. All right, 50.", "[About Alex] Still haven't told Casey yet, huh?", "Well, be careful how you break the news to him. He might kill you accidentally.", "My mom. I thought she was a prisoner that needed to be saved, and...then I come to find out she's just one of the bad guys.", "Maybe not. But there's one thing I do know. In order to find the one person who...left me, I've endangered the lives of everyone who would never leave me. Morgan, Casey, you. I'm gonna stop looking for my mom.", "No, it's okay. I thought I had to bring my family back together, but I don't. You guys, Awesome, Ellie, you're my family. I love you.", "Yeah.", "Hello.", "I just talked to one. That was my mom.", "No, no,no, no. Technically not just someone, my girlfriend - Sarah. Sarah this is my mom - Mary. I don't know how to say this exactly, but please don't kill each other.", "[Mary is driving nearly 100 mph and aiming her gun at him] Mom? You hit one pot-hole and this ride gets very messy very quick.", "My mom dropped me off.", "Oh, oh! That's right. I totally forgot. You can't believe in anyone unless Beckman tells you to.", "You and Alex?", "Listen, I was just waiting until I calmed down a little bit. Okay? It's our first real fight as a couple, and everyone knows that sets the tone for all future fights.", "See, that just makes it sound bad.", "Buddy, I need your help on a super top secret mission.", "No, you do not. Because nobody... ever does. But you do get to wear an earpiece.", "Tests? You'd have heard. By that I mean you would have heard my giant sigh of relief. Even in Moscow.", "I'm hoping very soon.", "Brutal? Can't wait to get started.", "Let's get physical.", "Do you really think that Sarah is the emotional rock that is sitting on the Intersect?", "Yeah, well you know....", "Or her own.", "I'm a spy!", "I think Sarah should let us handle this seeing how we have determined this is the only way I will get the Intersect back working.", "I'm sorry, I can only handle fake danger?", "Well I can take care of these wrong people without you holding my hand.", "Because this is what I do. I am a spy.", "[as Morgan brings him to pole dancing] Morgan, what sort of hand-to-hand combat did you sign us up for?", "Really!", "Mom... I already do.", "Forget it buddy, can't really do anything with Casey being well, Casey.", "[to Sarah, after Casey's pep talk] I don't need a balcony and I don't need a sunset. We have each other and that is all that matters.", "Sarah! Sarah. look I know you have to go...", "Wow. It's kind of like I'm cheating on you with you right now.", "Got it. See you in prison!", "[about his secret way of communicating with Sarah] Right now, she's telling me she loves me. Or she's buying a Buick...I can't really tell.", "I can't believe she's gonna name her Grunka.", "Dude!", "Dude!", "You can't.", "You know my dad... he taught me a lot of things. Like looks can be deceiving.", "Fight for your family.", "And of course never use a gun\u2014 [Volkoff fires the pistol but it is empty] \u2014unless you absolutely have to. I probably should have told you I have this thing about bullets. I was never going to kill you Alexi. But then I am my father's son, aren't I?", "[After Morgan comes rushing to Chuck to tell about the birth of Clara] General, General, can we borrow a van?", "Huh, I need to un-hear that. How do I un-hear that?", "I know, bad Three Stooges. I get it and I won't. But man it is dusty!", "If you must know, we are very much in love, happy and soon to be married. Just having a bit of a disagreement right now and the ball and chain isn't helping.", "There is a ball and ch... There is an actual ball and chain here. Do you not see this? On the ground attached to my leg? Ball and chain.", "I may have been a little obstinate before.", "No! I am adequate. More than adequate in that depart... [to Sarah] Right? You can't agree. I... Sarah I don't want to elope. I just don't, not at all, not even the slightest bit. I always wanted a big family wedding and now more than ever so no. My answer to eloping is no.", "Beckman was a dirty blonde?", "I don't want to know what goes on there.", "Where ya gonna go?", "So, moving to your mom's?", "Could be that, or it's a sex-crazed orgy party, where they don't let you see their faces or know their secrets.", "What?! What?! What?! What?! What?! Really?", "Having fun?", "Kinda takes your mind off the whole wedding thing doesn't it?", "Hey!", "I'm so glad you found a dress. That's awesome and I bet you look gorgeous in it. [to a teller] Don't be a hero my friend! I will break your face!", "[after hearing Sarah make several outrageous demands for the wedding] What the heck was that?", "Yeah, well... 'Cause I work... I work... I work at the Buy More, and that stuff sounds kind of pricey.", "[having just robbed a bank] Ha! You...", "[to Noble and Dunwoody] So, are you guys a couple or something?", "All we gotta do is break through four inches of steel.", "[shocked] Let's keep that as our backup plan, shall we?", "[outside Morgan and Casey's shared apartment] Let me in!", "Yeah.", "[nearly gloating] Well it's gonna be tough. Broke the mold, et cetera.", "[interrupts a disapproving Morgan] Actually... I've always secretly felt that way.", "It was, is.", "Well, it's good to see yours is going so well.", "Of course not. You know me. I don't know why she'd do this.", "Well. I really do that?", "Be cool.", "Just read it.", "The fine print says: I promise Chuck that I will not even contemplate the word divorce and I will never use my prenup.", "[to Sarah] Do our wedding colors remind you of socialism?", "...manipulative, amoral...", "Right my vows. My turn for vows. They just don't cut it. I'm sorry , Sarah. How do I express the depth of my love for you. Or my dreams for our future, or the fact that I will fight for you every day. Or that our kids will be like little superheroes with little capes and stuff like that. Words can't express that. Don't do it justice. they just don't cut it. So no vows. I'll just prove it to you every day for the rest of our lives. You can count on me.", "I can't afford it. If we bought it yesterday, with our fortune, we'd own it. But now...I'm so sorry, Sarah.", "But how are we gonna do this? We gotta start over.", "Buy More.", "The Buy More, we use the store to support the spy team, we take the profits and put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money. But in order for that to work, the store has to actually make profit.", "We can do that. What about me though? You and Casey are super spies, Morgan's the Intersect. Who am I? What's my job?", "[about the Intersect] ....scary, exciting, your hormones are all out of whack, you're really discovering your body!", "Perving out on Gertrude. Weird move Casey.", "You can keep the Intersect. Gollum!", "Anytime buddy.", "The force is strong in this one.", "Missile Command is a part of our process.", "Do you remember why we started Carmichael Industries to begin with?", "[Takes off headphones] Haha, someone coded the name into the telex script. The inside joke for anyone running viral counter measures. [Puts headphones back on]", "Shouldn't there be a third option?", "Noted.", "You wouldn't shoot me, would you?", "I've been training for a while now.", "I wouldn't be too sure about that.", "I'm a much bigger nerd than you thought I was.", "Well it wouldn't be Christmas with the Bartowskis without a little bit of drama.", "For defeating Daniel Shaw? For stopping the Omen virus? Or was it me getting us invited to rejoin the CIA?", "Technically it was Morgan that saved you. Because of all the saving that was going on, I didn't have time to get you your gift in time for Christmas. However. [Takes out charm bracelet.] An oldie but a goodie. [Puts it on Sarah's wrist] I hope it will suffice for now.", "I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this. But whatever you thought you had to hide, going out on your own like that, I think it was a mistake.

You know, this shirt has bad memories of you buying me stuff anyway [starts to take off his shirt]", "Well- Uh-W- One time I told her that she looked pretty when really she looked pretty skanky. And...and....Hyde, help me out here.", "Hyde.", "[Looks at Eric's barf] Eric, when did you eat spaghetti?", "Well, damn, Jackie. I can't control the weather!", "It's not real English if you speak it with a foreign accent.", "Uh, well... Remember when we went to nice restaurants and I told you to wait in the car while I paid? Did you ever wonder why I was running to the car?", "Well, if ham's Canadian bacon, then what the hell do you call bacon?!", "Every once in a while, do you ever get an American nickel in your change? [Looks at both mounties in turn]", "Are those snowshoes hard to walk in? They're tennis rackets, aren't they?", "A promise ring is not only a gift from the heart, but it also means more sex and less mouthin' off.", "Oh-ho, man! Oh, I hope I win this van. I really need a place to do it with Jackie.", "Hey, uh, puffy-shirt guy called. He wants his puffy shirt back.", "72936.... ampersand?", "You just [points to phone] ...oh man me neither.", "That's me. So, I've been thinking about great actors to model myself after and I choose Travolta.", "[impersonating Travolta as Tony Manero] Yeah, I stock this shelf! But someday I'm gonna dance across this whole city. [back to own voice] That's dead-on.", "Yeah we kinda expected that.", "Oh...You're gonna have to leave town!", "Obviously we're gonna tell everyone!", "Because he plays piano! Wait. [Donna whispers in his ear] Oh! BURN!", "Fez, the foundation of every good relationship is three words: I don't know. Where are you going? I don't know. What are you thinking about? I don't know. Who is that under you? I don't know. You see, it's bulletproof!", "Well, it's not because everyone doesn't want you to have one, that's for sure.", "I don't want to play Joseph as a carpenter. Oh! How about I play him as a spaceman?", "Really? Well, where do you think God lives?", "Yeah, I worked a double shift.", "[sees Jackie] Oh, didn't expect to see you here.", "No, wh-what is it now. You want me to drop out of high school, join the Salvation Army, and go off and fight wars?", "Yeah, Jackie, I don't have time for it right now. It just isn't important. Sound familiar. Alright then, you should go now.", "Oops, sorry!", "Damn, Donna. If you'd just let me see them, I'd stop!", "They're beautiful...[collapses]", "[groggy] Jackie? Am I dreaming?", "Are we gonna do it?", "Cool. Where's Donna?", "[As Red comes up behind him] Red! You're probably wanting to know why I'm looking through your stuff. [Red stares at Kelso menacingly] Ok, see I needed to borrow your saw because I needed to chop down a tree. [Red looks unconvinced] Because there's something stuck in it- an animal- a rabbit.[Pause] There's a rabbit stuck in a tree and I want to return that rabbit to the wild, so it can lay it's eggs.", "Um... Eric threw it up there. [Eric stares at Kelso in surprise]", "Yeah. He's a sadistic bastard. [Eric stares at Kelso in shock] You know he hit a cow once? [Eric lunges toward Kelso, but Donna pulls him back. They leave through the back door with the saw.]", "Guess what. I read your little \"everything's my fault\" article and I realized why I cheated. Remember the first time I kissed Pam Macy?", "And in the gym, and in her car. But, anyway\u2026 Earlier that day, I didn't have any money to buy you Tater Tots. And you said that I'd never be able to support you, 'cause I wasn't smart enough. And you're always puttin' me down like that, and it makes me feel bad about myself. And that is why I cheated.", "Just like that. And then I thought about it, and I realized that I'm not sorry either!", "I'm sayin' that we're not right for each other, because you make me feel bad! And\u2026 And\u2026 I don't think I can be with you anymore. I want to break up.", "No. [He leaves.]", "No, but I want a peanut butter and banana-[sees Hyde and Jackie; laughs] Why is Hyde kissing Jackie? [sees Eric and Donna's stares] What the hell? He's dead! [tries to walk out of kitchen]", "I can't believe that you knew that Jackie and Hyde were together and you didn't tell me.", "Well, that's true. It's just, how could Hyde do this to me?", "What, your mom knew?! And Fez?! Fez never knows anything!", "A little?", "As a joke?", "As a joke?", "[stands up] Relax. Guns don\u2019t just go off by accident.", "The gun went off by accident!", "[as announcer] And the canoeing champion for this year's Battle of the Network Stars is...Red Forman!", "Good, 'cause this hospital sucks! [Red, Kitty, and the gang look at him] What? [comes to conclusion] Ohhh! [whispers to Hyde] This hospital sucks.", "Nope, there's nobody here. Of course, I can't see people who don't have parties for their friends and maybe there is somebody here and I just can't see him. I CAN'T SEE YOU, ERIC.", "Yeah.", "[chuckles] Nice.", "Sorry I'm late but I was cutting through backyards and the Hendersons got a new jungle gym. Woah, he's still yelling?", "Hey I'll go spy on them. I just need to run home and change into my ninja outfit,", "Well doesn't mean it's not fun to wear, Eric.", "I had a hamster once. Tied him to a helium balloon with a note. He made it all the way to Minnesota.", "No, I\u2019m gonna send a dead hamster up in a balloon.", "Leo made me a grilled cheese once. He used butter and it made the crust extra toasty. He forgot cheese. I miss that grilled cheese-makin\u2019 son of a bitch!", "Nah, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a hot lady cop. Yah, just watch the master.", "Yeah, just give me a sec here. My wallet gets stuck \u2018cause I\u2019ve been workin\u2019 out. My leg muscles are huge. Oh boy. By the way, I can bench about 220 so that\u2019d be about - two of you little lady.", "Wooh, a citation for bein\u2019 too foxy in a school zone.", "Fez, unfortunately there are some people in this world that are going to judge you on the color of your skin, or your funny accent, or that girly little way you run. [Fez nods in agreement] But you know what, you're not alone. Why don't you think the Martians won't land here? Cause they're green, and they know people are going to make fun of them.", "Well, thats Canada. [Pause] Yep good ol' Canada. They don't make generalizations about people because they are too busy playing hockey, or getting drunk, or putting maple syrup on their ham. [Nina walks in]", "Hey, he might not be from this country, but he's beautiful, dammit!", "Eric. Enough with the Star Wars crap. Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown. And when I frown, my skin wrinkles. And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over and I like my free ride!", "Wha? No you don\u2019t gotta! Look at him! He's undressing me with his eyes, right now!", "Ohhh!", "Well, did it continue?!?", "Well, isn\u2019t it obvious? It means that I\u2019m gay!", "Something touched me deep inside the day that Hyde...lied [Hyde is giving Kelso a look]So bye, bye Mr. Steven Hyde.", "That's a burn about a burn, that's a second-degree burn.", "Yeah? About what?", "Excuse me.", "Burn!", "Burn!", "Burn!", "Burn!", "[to Kitty] Burn!", "Burn!", "[To everyone calmly] Burn. We totally did it!", "[defensively] I never touched her!", "She has to. They're in love.", "Trust me, they're one bottle of wine away from making out, just like you two.", "You better watch out, okay? Girls are talking to you. I think there might be a practical joke in the works.", "Well, I egged the valedictorian of my class, a marathon runner \u2014 oh, and some kids that took Latin.", "Nah, nah, you never could have stole her if I didn't cheat on her first.", "It, uh... that sounds a lot worse than what it is. I only cheated on her with Eric's sister, and the rest of the girls were when we were on a break because I annoyed her. But none of those were sisters except the two that were sisters.", "No, Brooke, wait... I've been with a lot of chicks, a lot... a lot... a lot.", "Look, just let me start over... We might not be the perfect match, okay, but I really, really like you. I think maybe us having this baby together is, like, fate.", "Fate. Man, never use a word in a fight if you don't really really know what it means.", "Yes sir. [Kelso goes into the car]", "[wear dog training collar] Cool, training collar. You know, I so don't get how they think I could be a stooge. Am I so on top of everything? What does this thing do? [presses button and gets shocked] AAH!", "Hey, guys. This is my co-cadet at the police academy, Suzy Simpson. Simpson, these are my friends. Take a good look, 'cause you'll probably be arresting some of them in the future.", "Look, alright. Simpson needed to get me a ride home 'cause I sprayed myself with mace to see what it would feel like.", "Hey, thanks for giving me a ride, Simpson.", "It totally wasn't my fault! I I got there early to practice with my flare gun because I wanted to show Brooke an actual \"B\" for a change.", "Then accidentally shot off a flare and it went [whistling sound] right under the bleachers.", "Kay, so then I shot off another flare at the first flare because you know what they say, you gotta \"fight fire with fire.\"", "So, then I shot another flare into the air to warn people about the fire and that one just went right on the roof, so I just got the hell out of there.", "One time, back when I was dating Jackie, I saw Pam washing her car. She leaned over and squeezed out the sponge...that's all I remember as I rode my bike straight into a tree.", "Officer Kennedy, you know my friends Hyde and Fez.", "No, sir. Not at all, sir.", "He's a good man.", "yeah the sweetest burns involve doing it with your mom.", "[holds up paddle] Duh.", "Fez, I'm riding an open canoe down a rocky mountain side. What could possibly go wrong?", "Ah, no, I'm not falling for that one.", "The old helmet gag.", "Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?... Now let go of the ropes and watch me fly!", "Woohoo!... Woohoo!... Ah, man! [tries pushing off with the paddle, stands up, gets out of canoe and throws away paddle] Stupid thing! [Canoe takes off down hill] Oh! Oh, man, that could have been me!", "No. Eric, I can't hear another one of your lame dreams. \"Guys, I dreamt I was purple and I could fly and Luke Skywalker was my lab partner.\"", "Eric, relax, okay? It's just a stress dream, 'cause you're gettin' married tomorrow. Now I had a dream last night that's worth telling. Okay, Donna was in a wet t-shirt contest [begins to visualize scene but stops it] No, I can't. Forget it. It's too dirty.", "All right. If anyone should be the best man, it's me. I'm gonna be a father, so I really need the money.", "Well, I can't do that, 'cause I'm bringin' Brooke. Yeah, we're getting pretty serious. Girls, man... you get 'em pregnant, they get all clingy.", "Man, I am glad to be here. I have had a rough day. Being around all this love and happiness oughtta cheer me right up. I mean, this is a happy day. Look at all the love. Wait, hey, where's Eric?", "Man, I can't believe I missed you falling out of the water tower. So I'm at home, and I'm watching Scooby-Doo, and I think to myself: \"You know what? You should go and hang out with Hyde and Donna.\" And then I think, \"No, because maybe Scooby and Shaggy found a real ghost this time.\" But it wasn't. It was just another crazy old guy.", "You know, Mrs. Pinciotti, in my younger days, I had quite the crush on you even though I knew nothing could ever happen. But now that I'm older, and I'm gonna be a father soon, if anything does happen, we gotta keep it quiet.", "Burn!", "Then say something.", "BURN!", "I'm sorry. Look, I've been screwed by Darwinism... never needed to evolve listening skills 'cause my looks are so highly developed.", "Yeah, sure it is. Look, say I had to catch my own food, right? But I only ate really fast animals? My feet would eventually evolve into rockets.", "[repeated line] You know what your problem is? I'm too good looking.", "Okay, we\u2019re gonna use my Police Academy training to figure out what happened here ... first thing I\u2019m gonna need is for everyone to lie face down with your hands behind your head.", "[after analyzing car] Okay, I think it\u2019s obvious [stands] what happened to Eric ...

Thats freaking awesome!", "Jacqueline Burkhart, will you marry me?", "No?", "Jackie, you just made me the happiest man on earth! I cant believe I wanted to marry you! That was my worst idea ever!

You don't want a person, you want a machine. I can't do that.", "I can't do what you want me to do.", "I can't pull the trigger.", "Because I'm not who you think I am. I'm not a killer.", "Who's Simone?", "Did Simone work for the Section? Michael, you can't tell me you had a wife and she was killed then just drop it, get back to business.", "You told me the facts. Michael, I want to know how you feel. Sometimes you have to let yourself trust someone. I'm right here.", "I'm so sorry.", "You have a right to feel anyway you want. Do you want to have a cup of coffee?", "Good.", "Sometimes I think you are the enemy.", "You know you're becoming very predictable, Michael. You lie, then you say you're sorry. You lie, then you say you're sorry. Can you come up with anything a little more interesting?", "Why shouldn't I... just kill you, hmmm? Why shouldn't I just pull the trigger?", "Do I have to love, honor and obey?", "Peter's my first, my only...true love.", "It's not what it seems!", "Please!

What's his life like outside? Does he even have one?", "It might.", "Does he even have a heart?", "Simone.", "Gee, Madeline, I thought you knew everything.", "Good night, Madeline.", "Michael?", "I know the plan. I'm sure you do, too.", "Of course.", "All right.", "What if I'm out of everything?", "Are you trying to seduce me? I've never been able to figure you out. Why should today... be different?", "You mean there's a backup system?", "You knew about his plan all the time, didn't you? This was all one big manipulation to keep me from going with him, wasn't it?", "But why? Why bother?", "Welcome back, Michael.", "Your cameras. I'm not having them in my apartment any more.", "No. And if you don't like it, you can-", "Cancel me, because I'd rather be dead than watched like an animal in the zoo.", "I'm very sure.", "Madeline, where do you go when you leave here?", "So how many years does it take for you to answer that question?", "What are you telling me? That I can't see him? That I can't care about him?", "Can I go now?", "Or?", "This place, the Section, is full of lies! They talk about all the innocent people they save, well what about the innocent people we hurt?

You got jealous of Gray because I love him and not you.", "How are you feeling?", "I was worried.", "When I was first recruited in the Section, you were my trainer. You decided whether or not I made it.", "How did you make your decision? What were you looking for? Is it some kind of checklist, 7 out of 10 I live, anything less I die?

She loves you. You? You're gonna destroy her.", "I see. So, that makes it okay?", "Death's easy - you don't have to do anything. It's life you have to face.", "What about all your words?", "I finally get it. I finally know... what attracts me to you. It's the character you pretend to be.

I put everything out of my mind. Even the things that I didn't want to forget. Do you know, for three years all I did was dream about getting out of the Section. When I did, it wasn't what I expected. This isn't freedom.

Jurgen doesn't want to hurt anybody. He's a decent person, why can't you accept that?", "Well, thanks for the enlightening, Michael. Can I go now? I was just curious, the night we had together, did it happen? Or was it just a dream?", "Thanks.", "Grab something to eat.", "Not really.", "I went out for dinner. Why? Is that a problem?", "All right, Michael. So, what is this? So, I went out for dinner. What do you care?", "Patented Michael answer, the blank stare. If you are jealous, just be jealous. Tell me not to see him.", "Maybe . . . Maybe not. But at least it would be something real. Emotion. Except of this cryptic game of 20 questions.", "So that's where we stand. You really don't care if I see Jurgen?", "I won't lie to you, I'm not happy to be here. But it's not about getting out anymore.", "How could you do this Michael?", "Not to him, to me.", "So that makes it ok? How far back does it go? My training with Jurgen? Or when you brought me in? The night we had together?", "Well, that's the first time you had the section wait for me.", "Well, that's just too little, too late. I am going to help Jurgen through this, if he lets me. Oh, I've become part of his life.", "Yes.", "If I say no, he's going to offer it to somebody else.", "What is the point?", "Of course\u2026.. not. He can make it easier for us. We could have the chance to spend more time together outside Section.", "Okay, well, if I'm dealing with the devil, it's because sometimes the devil is the only one open for business. But that's not the problem, is it? Michael, it bothers you that I have so much more power now. You don't like it. Maybe it even makes you a little...uncomfortable.", "Shall we just have a drink? No more games, no promises, just a drink.", "Birkoff. I need a favor.", "Wrong, Birkoff. Petrosian's little pet gets what she wants, or what they did to Walter will look like a foot massage compared with what I do to you if you mess with me.", "Better for whom?", "Petrosian was willing to give me a life, as much as one can have inside Section. But in order to get it, I lied, I bullied, and, who knows, eventually I might have even\u2026 killed in cold blood. In other words, I found out what it's like to...to be you.", "No, I didn't.", "You're wrong.", "Of course.", "I think I am beginning too...", "Hello, Michael.", "What's up?", "I would love to know how your mind works. Are you really that arrogant to think that you can turn me on and off at will?", "Careful?", "Two days ago you asked me out for dinner, Michael. Obviously you've changed your mind.", "Of course not.", "Now you're protecting him.", "Why would you protect him at all? After all the lectures to me about sacrificing feelings ... for the greater good, hm?", "There's something you're not telling me.", "Yes, you did. You should try talking to me the next time, Michael. Maybe you'll get better results.", "Why are you in his debt?", "Your sister?", "Didn't you tell me once that you can't separate the man from his actions? He's still a terrorist.", "Michael, disengage. Let the Section sort this out.", "Why are you telling me this?", "(She shoots and kills Ren\u00e9).", "Go ahead.", "Is that your secret, Michael? You just appear to be ruthless?", "You make it sound like it's alive.", "Path without feeling, compassion, or hope.", "We die so the section can live.", "I can't accept that.", "I understand that you are talking to me for once.", "Not today.", "Oh, no, you don't. That's how you hurt your back in the first place.", "I know, I know, I know . . . Michael?", "I love you.", "The debrief?", "At the time, no.", "Well, that all depends on you... how do you feel about it?", "Well, maybe I can help... we can talk about it.", "Yet?", "You will never make it. They will find you!", "Take a look around.", "I do.", "Actually, no.", "Walter, don't talk like that again.", "What does that mean?", "Michael, she tried to kill you. What are you gonna do about it?", "Why not? Cause you feel guilty?", "Walter, it's just this place. It gets to me sometimes, that's all. I was in pretty bad shape this time the last year. I don't wanna feel that way again.", "He was your husband.", "How could you kill him?", "Why don't you just quit with the English gentility and tell me what you want from me?", "Ok, Michael, now you lost me.", "Take your hands off me, please.", "I don't know.", "I don't know.", "I don't know.", "I don't know.", "What?", "What's the point, I'm not going to run.", "It's over when I say it's over.", "Today you do. Section's on trial. Defend it.", "Operations. Is that what it's about? Controlling the world?", "Michael, any words of wisdom?", "Yes it is.", "I didn't enjoy deceiving you Michael, but Adrian was listening, it had to be real.", "I told you before, I'm not going to run.", "Probably.", "I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.", "I haven't seen Michael in a while. Has he been reassigned somewhere else?", "Where is he?", "Home?", "Why?", "Michael... your marriage to Elena. What is it?", "She an operative?", "She doesn't know.", "So you're deceiving her to secure your cover? (Michael gives her the blank stare.) Is the child yours?", "For three years, you never told me you had a family, Michael.", "I understand this is something you've been ordered to do. I don't know how you're able to live with it.", "You know, I was thinking about Simone last night. You were still married to her when this started, weren't you?", "Was it difficult for her?", "I wish you could have told me about \u2026 this.", "Michael. I can't imagine what it must be like knowing that you're not going to see Adam again. You can't be like this. Not here. If there's anything that I can do.", "It might help to talk. You can't keep this inside you forever.", "If you change your mind, I'm here.", "So, what are you doing?", "Your security isn\u2019t engaged.", "That you can never give him?", "You\u2019re not well.", "Nothing happened between us, Birkoff.", "Well, from what I could tell, you're pretty delicious.", "She was convincing.", "I'm not in the habit of killing people in cold blood.", "Your psych profile suggests that by killing her, I can best exorcise her?", "I don't think so.", "Oh, so we just took him off the street? An innocent man? Do we do this kind of thing often, Michael?", "The crime that got Section's attention, the reason I'm here? I didn't do it.", "Suppose I was framed in the first place, because they wanted me here?", "Yeah, why?", "I'm a veteran here, Michael - I have my own sources, you know.", "I need to know why Section chose me.", "They brought me in Michael... just like they did Kruger.", "Maybe. Maybe not. If you won't help me, will you at least not interfere? Would you do that much for me? Please?", "Anything's better than not knowing.", "You knew it all along didn't you (Michael shows no emotion) Don't you ever get tired of being their errand boy Michael?", "Yeah.", "Well, I'd like that Michael, but I've already made plans. Perhaps some other time?", "I uh... I need a favor. Something from my old life's come up.", "My mother.", "She's been looking for me. She doesn't believe I'm dead.", "She had an indirect connection to someone at MI-6. I severed it. But she'll keep trying.", "No. They'll take extreme action. I want to protect her, Michael.", "Michael... I just wanted to... say thank you. That's the kindest thing you've ever done for me. Thank you.", "Michael. What's wrong?", "How? It's impossible.", "I didn't realize you had such talent in the kitchen, Michael.", "How long do you think we'll stay here?", "I'm so glad you brought me here. I wish we could stay.", "How is this going to work?", "There's another option, I mean, we can live the day like its our last.", "Thank you.", "Well it wasn't as good as the meal you cooked at the cabin.", "You know it can't be casual between you and me. I can't do that.", "I don't know. Maybe nothing, but I have to try.I have to try. I can't leave these women here, I have to help them. Michael, you've got a sister. When you went to prison, she was all alone. She could have ended up in a place like this if she hadn't been helped.", "How do you do it? How do you stay sane? What's the secret?Walter: Knowing when to lie, and when to tell the truth.Nikita: To them?Walter: To yourself. At night you go to bed knowing you live in hell. That's the truth.Nikita: And the lie?Walter: And you wake up in the morning thinking that this day may change everything\u2026you'll escape, you'll fall in love, they'll close the place up and send everybody home.Nikita: Then that night you have to face the truth again.Walter: Yeah. But in the meantime, you've accomplished something that's truly remarkable. You've made it through another day.", "Nothing. It\u2019s just unusual. You sticking your neck out to help.", "For what?", "Sometimes I do things differently than what you would like, but I've set boundaries for myself, if I was to work outside those boundaries, I couldn't live with myself.", "I know. It's about the Section, right?", "That's one way to put it. I don't know what was more unusual; Operations blowing up Section or you coming for dinner again.", "But you did.

I know exactly who my son is!", "He paid for mine...", "Hello there, Michael.", "To what do I owe the pleasure?", "Having you gone is something I've gotten used to. You know what was hard?

I can do what I have to for at least the next six hours.", "It was wrong of me to put you in this position. Operations was right.", "Yes, he was.", "There was no way to bring him back, his presence outside the Section for so many years would undermine our credibility, and letting him go wasn't an option. He understood that.", "I didn't open anything up, I slept with you. There's a difference.", "Because you wanted it.", "That's irrelevant. The foreplay was becoming a distraction to both of us. It was affecting your work and decisions, and in turn affecting mine.", "What we had, has been over for years, the other night doesn't change a thing. I think you need to face that.", "That's why we selected her, because of her ambivalence. She didn't deceive you so much as she allowed you to deceive yourself.", "Yes. Are the crimes we've committed worse that the crimes we've prevented? And the people we've brought down, is the world a better place without them?", "Then you have your answer.", "...I'd rather deal with one recalcitrant operative than a mutiny. [...] Increase her mission frequency. Eventually, the problem will take care of itself.", "No.", "Home, I think.", "Why? Because you think this made a difference? Next time, Michael, pick your conspirators more carefully. We fed Birkoff false information. You'll never be able to link us to Adrian's death. Not as long as I'm here.", "He as well. It's true our original intention was to eliminate you. That's been changed.", "And your value as an operative remains strong. That will be all.", "Elena has been released from the hospital. Physically, she's fine.", "Would you like us to copy you on their progress reports? I think we should acknowledge the personal sacrifice Michael has made and give him some time alone.", "You can go, Michael.", "My point is, if we push Michael too hard we may destroy him and that would be a pity.", "In this case, you might want to make an exception. In a manner of speaking, she possessed you, in body as well as mind.", "Yes.", "If I do it instead, I think you'll regret it, but the choice is yours.", "Of course I do. Admiration, respect, friendship.", "Don't do this.", "Not too weak. Sarah, I know you\u2019re more comfortable here alone. Being with other people has always been difficult for you.

Have you had your meeting with Michael yet, or were you on your way to it? Whenever your last meeting with Michael was, I hope you made the most of it. It\u2019s the last one you\u2019ll ever have.", "Michael means nothing to her. Not anymore. She's a perfect robot", "Is that a problem?", "That's what I told Operations. He's not convinced. Regardless of Adrian, he's thinking about reinstating your cancellation orders.", "You're not afraid to die, are you Michael?", "... So you two are using Nikita to kill Operations.", "Because you'll inherit his post.", "Oh yes. But the question is, when?", "Once you come through those doors, you have two choices; one is compliance, the other is self-explanatory. Make no mistake, if any of you have any delusions about leaving here, I'd erase them immediately.", "Where's Michael? Using Michael's corneal access is grounds for cancellation.", "You don't think you'll get away with this. I'm sorry for you, Nikita.", "It's taken a long time for us to come to this point, hasn't it?", "Nikita's condition eight. Shoot to kill.", "You have an unusual opportunity, Mr. Crawford, your fate at Section is in your hands.

Keep stalking me, and I'll wipe your memory!", "Look, any conversation between us, no matter what the subject, is over, finished, done, forever!

[Gwen looks at him] From where I'm standing...it looks good to me.", "[grins] Ianto! We're having a baby. [Ianto comes over, looking surprised and delighted. To Gwen;] Have you told Rhys yet?", "Oh, you told me before you told him- he is gonna love that! [Gwen laughs weakly]", "You did what?!", "Worse than that, do I have to stay in these clothes? I mean, come on! Tracksuit bottoms? Not a good look!", "It wasn't the best of days.", "...I felt it.", "Yeah.", "I'm a fixed point in time and space. That's what the Doctor says. I think that means it's forever.", "Yeah...", "Yeah. Suppose.", "[pauses, then grins] Ianto, the world could be ending.", "[grins, and turns to Rhys] Rhys, do you want to take the car down to those shops by the Wharf? We need some discs for these things. Should take about twenty minutes.", "[quickly] Thirty!", "[disappointed] Beans are almost done.", "[shakes his head] No, you couldn't.", "[turns around] Ianto, tell me; what should I have done?", "Ianto, that's all there is.", "There's a saying here on Earth. A very old, very wise friend of mine taught me it; An injury to one is an injury to all. And when people act accordingly to the philosophy, the human race is the finest species in the universe.", "Uh, I like the philosophy.", "[joins Ianto, holds up his gun at the tank] You've made your point now stop this and we can talk!", "What's that noise? What's it doing? [...] [to Ianto] We need to get you out of here.

Please!", "Yeah.", "[shakes head] Never could.", "Yes I will. I promise, I will. [Ianto begins to gasp for breath, then closes his eyes - he is dead] Ianto? Ianto? Don't go, don't leave me, please. Please, don't--", "He's right. Look what happened. Phone Rhys...tell him we lost.", "I missed that. The Welsh complaining. [to Gwen] You look good.", "Yeah.", "Travelled all sorts of places.

And what got you so involved?", "I know the feeling.", "Torchwood no longer exists.", "I suppose it must be. [grimaces]", "Yeah. I hurt my arm.", "Yeah, another one. The Torchwood Institute was set up by the British Royal Family in 1879 to defend the realm of Great Britain by investigating the unusual, the strange. And the alien.", "Alien. As in extraterrestrial.", "This whole situation worldwide, that's exactly the kind of thing we used to investigate.", "She's still alive. The last one left. And I'm gonna keep her safe, which means making sure that the Institute stays dead and buried.", "Wasn't me. God knows who it was. But that was enough to call me back, and I got to work releasing the malware, destroying hard copies, removing all traces of the word, using Retcon. What's Retcon?", "It's a smart drug.

It's not healing.", "I'm staying hurt.", "I know.", "...And I mortal. I don't mend. I'm normal again. I'm plain old human.", "Doesn't concern you.", "Great, so it's my fault?", "Rhys, are you defending me?", "It's like there's some sort of energy behind this. A will, a drive, a consciousness, because this miracle, it's more than people just surviving. They are so alive. You saw Lyn, that woman at the airport. She should have been paralysed but she just kept on going. And I've seen bodies at the morgue, burnt and broken, still alive, staring right at me. They weren't even allowed to be unconscious. It's as if something is willing them to go on, each and every individual forced into life.", "Well, that's the problem. Everybody's had the same idea. Morphic field gets ten million results.", "Ahem. So, who's giving the orders?", "We need to steal a new car. [grins]", "I was thinking. About how you're immortal. And I'm dying. And what I wanted to say was... we're good aren't we? You and I? Good team. I missed you.", "I know.", "Dead friends.", "I wish he was here now. Not much of a team, is it? But we've still got each other. You and me. Just like the old days.", "Now I understand. You're doing all this because you're searching for one thing. One simple thing. Execution. We're without death, so you get to live. And it's killing you.", "Our greatest problem is that what's happened to the world is invisible. Quite by chance Oswald's found himself right at the heart of it. George Elliot wrote this chapter in Middlemarch. She said that if you take a piece of metal with random scratches all over it and hold a flame up to the metal, the scratches look like they're forming patterns. Circling around the light. And that Oswald. He's blazin' away. The patterns are starting to revolve around him. And all we have to do is keep watching.", "Ordinary people are Category Three.", "Worse than that, this process has given the United Nations a definition for life which is therefore a definition of death. The government now has the power to decide whether you're dead or alive. No one should have that much control.", "He's on his way.", "No, no, no. Wait a minute. That's why we sent Rex.", "...Okay. I'm going with you. I don't know, I could be your... assistant.", "All I get is a kiss?", "What happens after this, Oswald?

Why am I tied down?", "What?", "My hands are asleep. And my feet. You tied my feet?", "Are you sure they have your family?", "I want to talk to the lenses.

Are you listening?", "You want me? Let her family go and I'll come to you alone.", "No, just me. Let Rhys go, let Anwen go, let her mother go free. You guys, you know what? Here I am.

Now that I'm mortal, I'm gonna hang onto this with everything I've got. I love you, Gwen Cooper, but I will rip your skin from your skull before I let you take this away from me. Understood?", "Yeah. Right at the end.", "Time to move on. But not with you.", "Something happened to me once, a long way away. Time itself changed me to a fixed point. And now I can't die.

I knew this stuff the second I saw it. Yes, it's alien technology. The only examples of it on Earth were in the Torchwood Hub. They were buried in the ruins.", "He must have salvaged it, knowing the Miracle was coming.", "Maybe that was revenge, or maybe giving me a clue. But there's only one course of action left now. You have to get me out of here.", "Turn your head.", "Keep your head down. Be calm.", "There's a reason why Torchwood was secret. We kept things hidden from the human race. This technology is a science the world should never know.", "I know, Esther, because I've seen the future. I've walked the future world and breathed its air. And this technology would send it to damnation. Just imagine the stealth technology of a null field hiding bombs, hiding planes, shielding one side from radiation while the other side burns. This thing would be the end of us. This timeline would be terminal.", "But you trust me, don't you? Both of you? After all we've done? Please, I'm begging you, get me out of here.

Please, get me out.", "What did he do?", "What's she translating?", "I think I can get us in. Back in the old days, Torchwood tracked down a black market trade in alien artefacts coming out of China.

[walks to the cleft in the world and cuts his finger. His blood flies into it] It wants me. Mortal blood. The only one in the whole world. So I suggest you're very careful with me, okay?", "You know why it did that? I think you hurt it. It was being attacked, so it took the blood pattern and made it a gift. It's exerting itself to sustain every person on the planet. This whole Miracle, it's trying to be kind.", "But before you launched this brave new world, you had to deal with one more thing. Yeah. Me.", "Well, you failed. I got to Shanghai. I've got the only mortal blood on the planet. If it gets into The Blessing, life switches back. I can make the whole world mortal.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa.", "Oh, my God.", "Nobody move! Huh? Wow, Rex, you're a genius!", "I think I've lived long enough.
